	abstract = {We present deep Very Large Array observations of the polarization of radio sources in the GOODS-N ﬁeld at 1.4 GHz at resolutions of 1.6 and 10 . At 1.6, we ﬁnd that the peak ﬂux cumulative number count distribution is N ({\textgreater}p) ∼ 45∗(p/30 μJy)−0.6 per square degree above a detection threshold of 14.5 μJy. This represents a break from the steeper slopes at higher ﬂux densities, resulting in fewer sources predicted for future surveys with the Square Kilometer Array and its precursors. It provides a signiﬁcant challenge for using background rotation measures (RMs) to study clusters of galaxies or individual galaxies. Most of the polarized sources are well above our detection limit, and they are also radio galaxies that are well-resolved even at 10 , with redshifts from ∼0.2–1.9. We determined a total polarized ﬂux for each source by integrating the 10 polarized intensity maps, as will be done by upcoming surveys such as POSSUM. These total polarized ﬂuxes are a factor of two higher, on average, than the peak polarized ﬂux at 1.6; this would increase the number counts by ∼50\% at a ﬁxed ﬂux level. The detected sources have RMs with a characteristic rms scatter of ∼11 rad m−2 around the local Galactic value, after eliminating likely outliers. The median fractional polarization from all total intensity sources does not continue the trend of increasing at lower ﬂux densities, as seen for stronger sources. The changes in the polarization characteristics seen at these low ﬂuxes likely represent the increasing dominance of star-forming galaxies.},

We introduce the rotation measure transfer function (RMTF), which is an excellent predictor of nπ ambiguity problems with the λ2 coverage. Rotation measure synthesis can be implemented very eﬃciently on modern computers. Because the analysis is easily applied to wide ﬁelds, one can conduct very fast RM surveys of weak spatially extended sources. Diﬃcult situations, for example multiple sources along the line of sight, are easily detected and transparently handled. Under certain conditions, it is even possible to recover the emission as a function of Faraday depth within a single cloud of ionized gas. Rotation measure synthesis has already been successful in discovering widespread, weak, polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster (de Bruyn \& Brentjens 2005). In simple, high signal to noise situations it is as good as traditional linear ﬁts to χ versus λ2 plots. However, when the situation is more complex or very weak polarized emission at high rotation measures is expected, it is the only viable option.},

For a detection threshold of \$5 {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{QU\}\$, the false detection rate increases to {\textasciitilde}4\%, depending also on \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textasciicircum}2\$ coverage and the extent of the Faraday spectrum. Non-Gaussian noise in Stokes Q and U due to imperfect imaging and calibration can be represented by a distribution that is the sum of a Gaussian and an exponential. The non-Gaussian wings of the noise distribution increase the false detection rate in polarized intensity by orders of magnitude. Monte-Carlo simulations assuming non-Gaussian noise in Q and U, give false detection rates at \$8 {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{QU\}\$ similar to Ricean false detection rates at \$4.9 {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{QU\}\$.},

mass-independent Eddington ratio distribution functions (ERDFs). We
assume that black holes can be divided into two independent groups:
those with radiatively efficient accretion, primarily hosted by
optically blue and green galaxies, and those with radiatively
inefficient accretion, which are mainly found in red galaxies. With
observed galaxy stellar mass functions as input, we show that the
observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity functions can be
reproduced by using mass-independent, broken power-law-shaped ERDFs. We
use the observed hard X-ray and 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions to
constrain the ERDF for radiatively efficient and inefficient AGNs,
respectively. We also test alternative ERDF shapes and mass-dependent
models. Our results are consistent with a mass-independent AGN fraction
and AGN hosts being randomly drawn from the galaxy population. We argue
that the ERDF is not shaped by galaxy-scale effects, but by how
efficiently material can be transported from the inner few parsecs to
the accretion disc. Our results are incompatible with the simplest form
of mass quenching where massive galaxies host higher accretion rate
AGNs. Furthermore, if reaching a certain Eddington ratio is a sufficient
condition for maintenance mode, it can occur in all red galaxies, not
just the most massive ones.},

We derive a new empirical classiﬁcation scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus–H II (AGN–H II) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [O III] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [O III] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[O III]/σ 4, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we ﬁnd that at ﬁxed L[O III]/σ 4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/LEDD and Seyferts dominant at high L/LEDD. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation ﬁeld with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.},

This study uses data from the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey, a combination of single-antenna spectro-polarimetric studies, including northern sky data from the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) 26 m telescope (1270-1750 MHz) and southern sky data from the Parkes 64 m telescope (300-480 MHz). From the synthesized Faraday spectral cubes we compute the zeroth, first, and second moments to find the total polarized emission, mean RM, and RM width of the polarized emission. From DRAO first moments we find a weak vertical field directed from Galactic North to South, but Parkes data reveal fields directed toward the Sun at high latitudes in both hemispheres: the two surveys clearly sample different volumes. DRAO second moments show feature widths in Faraday spectra increasing with decreasing positive latitudes, implying that longer lines of sight encounter more Faraday rotating medium, but this is not seen at negative latitudes. Parkes data show the opposite: at positive latitudes the second moment decreases with decreasing latitude, but not at negative latitudes. Comparing first moments with RMs of pulsars and extragalactic sources and a study of depolarization together confirm that the DRAO survey samples to larger distances than the Parkes data. Emission regions in the DRAO survey are typically 700-1000 pc away, slightly beyond the scale height of the magneto-ionic medium; emission detected in the Parkes survey is entirely within the magneto-ionic disk, less than 500 pc away.},

mostly unresolved radio sources between 1.3 and 2.0 GHz using data taken
with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We have used
rotation-measure synthesis to identify Faraday-complex polarized
sources, those objects whose frequency-dependent polarization behavior
indicates the presence of material possessing complicated magnetoionic
structure along the line of sight (LOS). For sources classified as
Faraday-complex, we have analyzed a number of their radio and
multiwavelength properties to determine whether they differ from
Faraday-simple polarized sources (sources for which LOS magnetoionic
structures are comparatively simple) in these properties. We use this
information to constrain the physical nature of the magnetoionic
structures responsible for generating the observed complexity. We detect
Faraday complexity in 12\% of polarized sources at ∼1‧
resolution, but we demonstrate that underlying signal-to-noise
limitations mean the true percentage is likely to be significantly
higher in the polarized radio source population. We find that the
properties of Faraday-complex objects are diverse, but that complexity
is most often associated with depolarization of extended radio sources
possessing a relatively steep total intensity spectrum. We find an
association between Faraday complexity and LOS structure in the Galactic
interstellar medium (ISM) and claim that a significant proportion of the
Faraday complexity we observe may be generated at interfaces of the ISM
associated with ionization fronts near neutral hydrogen structures.
Galaxy cluster environments and internally generated Faraday complexity
provide possible alternative explanations in some cases.},

This Very Large Telescope (VLA) survey reaches a detection sensitivity of 1 mJy at 20 cm over a final footprint of 10,575 deg2 that is largely coincident with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) area. Both the images and a catalog containing 946,432 sources are available through the FIRST Web site (http://sundog.stsci.edu). We record here the authoritative survey history, including hardware and software changes that affect the catalog's reliability and completeness. In particular, we use recent observations taken with the JVLA to test various aspects of the survey data (astrometry, CLEAN bias, and the flux density scale). We describe a new, sophisticated algorithm for flagging potential sidelobes in this snapshot survey, and show that fewer than 10\% of the cataloged objects are likely sidelobes, and that these are heavily concentrated at low flux densities and in the vicinity of bright sources, as expected. We also report a comparison of the survey with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), as well as a match of the FIRST catalog to the SDSS and Two Micron Sky Survey (2MASS) sky surveys. The NVSS match shows very good consistency in flux density scale and astrometry between the two surveys. The matches with 2MASS and SDSS indicate a systematic ∼10-20 mas astrometric error with respect to the optical reference frame in all VLA data that has disappeared with the advent of the JVLA. We demonstrate strikingly different behavior between the radio matches to stellar objects and to galaxies in the optical and IR surveys reflecting the different radio populations present over the flux density range 1-1000 mJy. As the radio flux density declines, stellar counterparts (quasars) get redder and fainter, while galaxies get brighter and have colors that initially redden but then turn bluer near the FIRST detection limit. Implications for future radio sky surveys are also briefly discussed. In particular, we show that for radio source identification at faint optical magnitudes, high angular resolution observations are essential, and cannot be sacrificed in exchange for high signal-to-noise data. The value of a JVLA survey as a complement to Square Kilometer Array precursor surveys is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Many important structured prediction problems, including learning to rank items, correspondence-based natural language processing, and multi-object tracking, can be formulated as weighted bipartite matching optimizations. Existing structured prediction approaches have signiﬁcant drawbacks when applied under the constraints of perfect bipartite matchings. Exponential family probabilistic models, such as the conditional random ﬁeld (CRF), provide statistical consistency guarantees, but suffer computationally from the need to compute the normalization term of its distribution over matchings, which is a \#P-hard matrix permanent computation. In contrast, the structured support vector machine (SSVM) provides computational efﬁciency, but lacks Fisher consistency, meaning that there are distributions of data for which it cannot learn the optimal matching even under ideal learning conditions (i.e., given the true distribution and selecting from all measurable potential functions). We propose adversarial bipartite matching to avoid both of these limitations. We develop this approach algorithmically, establish its computational efﬁciency and Fisher consistency properties, and apply it to matching problems that demonstrate its empirical beneﬁts.},

Conversely, finding unexpected objects or phenomena within such large volumes of data presents a challenge that may best be solved using computational and statistical approaches. We present the application of a coarse-grained complexity measure for identifying interesting observations in large astronomical data sets. This measure, which has been termed apparent complexity, has been shown to model human intuition and perceptions of complexity. Apparent complexity is computationally efficient to derive and can be used to segment and identify interesting observations in very large data sets based on their morphological complexity. We show, using data from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey, that apparent complexity can be combined with clustering methods to provide an automated process for distinguishing between images of galaxies which have been classified as having simple and complex morphologies. The approach generalizes well when applied to new data after being calibrated on a smaller data set, where it performs better than tested classification methods using pixel data. This generalizability positions apparent complexity as a suitable machine-learning feature for identifying complex observations with unanticipated features.},

These faint polarized radio sources are mostly AGNs with luminosities below the traditional FRI/FRII boundary.

We detect 958 radio sources in Stokes I of which 136 are detected in polarization. We present the Euclidean-normalized polarized differential source counts down to 400 μJy. These counts indicate that sources have a higher degree of fractional polarization at fainter Stokes I flux density levels than for brighter sources, confirming an earlier result. We find that the majority of our polarized sources are steep-spectrum objects with a mean spectral index of –0.77, and there is no correlation between fractional polarization and spectral index. We also matched deep field sources to counterparts in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters catalog. Of the polarized sources, 77\% show structure at the arcsecond scale whereas only 38\% of the sources with no detectable polarization show such structure. The median fractional polarization for resolved sources is 6.8\%, while it is 4.4\% for compact objects. The polarized radio sources in our deep field are predominantly those sources which are resolved and show the highest degrees of fractional polarization, indicating that the lobe dominated structure may be the source of the highly polarized sources. These resolved radio galaxies dominate the polarized source counts at mJy.},

	abstract = {Galaxy morphology is a fundamental quantity, that is essential not only for the full spectrum of galaxy-evolution studies, but also for a plethora of science in observational cosmology. While a rich literature exists on morphological-classification techniques, the unprecedented data volumes, coupled, in some cases, with the short cadences of forthcoming 'Big-Data' surveys (e.g. from the LSST), present novel challenges for this field. Large data volumes make such datasets intractable for visual inspection (even via massively-distributed platforms like Galaxy Zoo), while short cadences make it difficult to employ techniques like supervised machine-learning, since it may be impractical to repeatedly produce training sets on short timescales. Unsupervised machine learning, which does not require training sets, is ideally suited to the morphological analysis of new and forthcoming surveys. Here, we employ an algorithm that performs clustering of graph representations, in order to group image patches with similar visual properties and objects constructed from those patches, like galaxies. We implement the algorithm on the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru-Strategic-Program Ultra-Deep survey, to autonomously reduce the galaxy population to a small number (160) of 'morphological clusters', populated by galaxies with similar morphologies, which are then benchmarked using visual inspection. The morphological classifications (which we release publicly) exhibit a high level of purity, and reproduce known trends in key galaxy properties as a function of morphological type at z{\textless}1 (e.g. stellar-mass functions, rest-frame colours and the position of galaxies on the star-formation main sequence). Our study demonstrates the power of unsupervised machine learning in performing accurate morphological analysis, which will become indispensable in this new era of deep-wide surveys.},

We investigate the photometric redshift performance obtained with ugriz photometry from VSTATLAS and W1/W2 from WISE, based on several empirical and template methods. The best redshift errors are obtained with kernel-density estimation, as are the lowest biases, which are consistent with zero within statistical noise. The 68th percentiles of the redshift scatter for magnitude-limited samples at r {\textless} (15.5, 17.5, 19.5) are (0.014, 0.017, 0.028). In this magnitude range, there are no known ambiguities in the colour-redshift map, consistent with a small rate of redshift outliers. In the fainter regime, the KDE method produces p(z) estimates per galaxy that represent unbiased and accurate redshift frequency expectations. The p(z) sum over any subsample is consistent with the true redshift frequency plus Poisson noise. Further improvements in redshift precision at r {\textless} 20 would mostly be expected from ﬁlter sets with narrower passbands to increase the sensitivity of colours to small changes in redshift.},

	abstract = {We present a stationary, axisymmetric, self-similar semi-analytic model of magnetically dominated jet plasma based on force-free regions of a relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We use this model to illustrate how the composition of relativistic jet plasma can be determined, with special attention to the example of M87. In particular, we compute synthetic Stokes maps in e-e+p plasmas with various positron-to-proton ratios using synchrotron emission models scaling the partial pressure of electrons and positrons emitting at the observed frequency to the magnetic pressure, taking into account Faraday rotation and conversion. The lepton-dominated models produce bilaterally asymmetric radio intensity profiles with strong linear polarization and Stokes Q and U maps that are bilaterally asymmetric (but strongly up-down correlated) and antisymmetric (and sometimes up-down anticorrelated), respectively. The hadronic models produce more centrally brightened intensity and polarization maps. Circular polarization provides the cleanest observational tool for distinguishing the plasmas, as it increases outward from the jet core and central axis for highly ionic plasma, and is suppressed for pair dominated plasma. We find a measurable degree of circular polarization V/I of O(10e-3) for sub-equipartition hadronic jet plasmas. Our stationary model predicts that the intensity-normalized autocorrelation functions of Q and U increase and decrease with frequency, respectively. On the other hand, the autocorrelation of V is less sensitive to the frequency. Multi-band polarimetric observations could therefore be used as a novel probe of the composition of jet plasma.},

	abstract = {Future radio surveys will generate catalogs of tens of millions of radio sources, for which redshift estimates will be essential to achieve many of the science goals. However, spectroscopic data will be available for only a small fraction of these sources, and in most cases even the optical and infrared photometry will be of limited quality. Furthermore, radio sources tend to be at higher redshift than most optical sources (most radio surveys have a median redshift greater than 1) and so a significant fraction of radio sources hosts differ from those for which most photometric redshift templates are designed. We therefore need to develop new techniques for estimating the redshifts of radio sources. As a starting point in this process, we evaluate a number of machine-learning techniques for estimating redshift, together with a conventional template-fitting technique. We pay special attention to how the performance is affected by the incompleteness of the training sample and by sparseness of the parameter space or by limited availability of ancillary multiwavelength data. As expected, we find that the quality of the photometric-redshift degrades as the quality of the photometry decreases, but that even with the limited quality of photometry available for all-sky-surveys, useful redshift information is available for the majority of sources, particularly at low redshift. We find that a template-fitting technique performs best in the presence of high-quality and almost complete multi-band photometry, especially if radio sources that are also X-ray emitting are treated separately, using specific templates and priors. When we reduced the quality of photometry to match that available for the EMU all-sky radio survey, the quality of the template-fitting degraded and became comparable to some of the machine-learning methods. Machine learning techniques currently perform better at low redshift than at high redshift, because of incompleteness of the currently available training data at high redshifts.},

	abstract = {We cross-match the two currently largest all-sky photometric catalogs-mid-infrared Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and SuperCOSMOS scans of UKST/POSS-II photographic plates-to obtain a new galaxy sample that covers 3π steradians. In order to characterize and purify the extragalactic data set, we use external GAMA and Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic information to define quasar and star loci in multicolor space, aiding the removal of contamination from our extended source catalog. After appropriate data cleaning, we obtain a deep wide-angle galaxy sample that is approximately 95\% pure and 90\% complete at high Galactic latitudes. The catalog contains close to 20 million galaxies over almost 70\% of the sky, outside the Zone of Avoidance and other confused regions, with a mean surface density of more than 650 sources per square degree. Using multiwavelength information from two optical and two mid-IR photometric bands, we derive photometric redshifts for all the galaxies in the catalog, using the ANNz framework trained on the final GAMA-II spectroscopic data. Our sample has a median redshift of \{z\}\{med\}=0.2, with a broad \{dN\}/\{dz\} reaching up to z {\textgreater} 0.4. The photometric redshifts have a mean bias of {\textbar} δ z{\textbar} ˜ \{10\}-3, a normalized scatter of σ z = 0.033, and less than 3\% outliers beyond 3σ z . Comparison with external data sets shows no significant variation of photo-z quality with sky position. Together with the overall statistics, we also provide a more detailed analysis of photometric redshift accuracy as a function of magnitudes and colors. The final catalog is appropriate for "all-sky" three-dimensional (3D) cosmology to unprecedented depths, in particular through cross-correlations with other large-area surveys. It should also be useful for source preselection and identification in forthcoming surveys, such as TAIPAN or WALLABY.},

	abstract = {We present the Influence Flower, a new visual metaphor for the influence profile of academic entities, including people, projects, institutions, conferences, and journals. While many tools quantify influence, we aim to expose the flow of influence between entities. The Influence Flower is an ego-centric graph, with a query entity placed in the centre. The petals are styled to reflect the strength of influence to and from other entities of the same or different type. For example, one can break down the incoming and outgoing influences of a research lab by research topics. The Influence Flower uses a recent snapshot of Microsoft Academic Graph, consisting of 212million authors, their 176 million publications, and 1.2 billion citations. An interactive web app, Influence Map, is constructed around this central metaphor for searching and curating visualisations. We also propose a visual comparison method that highlights change in influence patterns over time. We demonstrate through several case studies that the Influence Flower supports data-driven inquiries about the following: researchers' careers over time; paper(s) and projects, including those with delayed recognition; the interdisciplinary profile of a research institution; and the shifting topical trends in conferences. We also use this tool on influence data beyond academic citations, by contrasting the academic and Twitter activities of a researcher.},

In particular, we are concerned with big data applications where there are sufficient in-control data that can be used to specify certain quantiles of interest which, in turn, are used to assess whether the new, incoming data to be monitored are in control. The distribution-free chart is shown to lose very little power against the Shewhart charts designed for normally distributed data. The proposed charts offer a practical and robust alternative to the classical Shewhart charts which assume normality, particularly when monitoring quantiles and the data distribution is skewed. The effect of the size of the reference sample is examined on the assumption that the quantiles are known. Conclusions and recommendations are offered.},

The length of the active phase has a strong dependence on the stellar mass of the host galaxy. Radio sources in the most massive hosts are also retriggered more frequently. The time spent in the active phase has the same dependence on stellar mass as does the gas cooling rate, suggesting the onset of the quiescent phase is due to fuel depletion. We ﬁnd radio and emission-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity to be independent, consistent with these corresponding to different accretion states.},

	abstract = {The dominant source of radio emission from quasars has been debated for decades. We present the radio luminosity function (RLF) of optically-selected quasars below 1 mJy, constructed by applying a Bayesian-ﬁtting stacking technique to objects below the nominal radio ﬂux-density limit. We test the technique using simulated data, conﬁrming that we can reconstruct the RLF over three orders of magnitude below the typical 5σ threshold, although this is dependent on the number density of the population in question. We apply our method to 1.4-GHz ﬂux-densities from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey, extracted at the positions of optical quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7) over seven redshift bins. The lowest redshift bin (0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.45) constitutes a volume-limited sampled deﬁned by Mi {\textless} −23 and we measure the optically-selected quasar RLF over two orders of magnitude below the FIRST detection threshold of 1 mJy. We ﬁnd that our measured RLF is in agreement with deeper data from the literature. We ﬁnd that the radio luminosity function for the radio-loud quasars ﬂattens around log10[L1.4/W Hz−1] ≈ 25, where radio-quiet quasars start to emerge. The radio luminosity were radio-quiet quasars emerge coincides with the luminosity where star-forming galaxies start to dominate the radio source counts. This implies that there could be a signiﬁcant contribution from star formation in the host galaxies, but additional data is required to investigate this further. The higher-redshift bins show similar behaviour (i.e. RLF shape) as for the lowest-z bin, at least up to z = 2.15, implying that the same physical process may be responsible.},

The resulting catalog of RM values covers the sky area north of declination –40° with an average density of more than one RM per square degree. We present an image of the median RM over 82\% of the sky with a resolution of 8° and a typical error of ±1-2 rad m–2. The image shows large-scale structures in RM that extend to very high Galactic latitudes. A simple analysis of the RM structure at high Galactic latitudes is used to derive properties of the Galactic halo magnetic field in the solar neighborhood. We find the component of the local field perpendicular to the plane (the z-component) equal to +0.30 μG for z 0. The reversal of sign across the Galactic plane is consistent with a quadrupole field geometry for the poloidal component of the halo field. The halo magnetic field component parallel to the disk is also found to be antisymmetric and generally consistent with a toroidal field, with strength +0.83 μG for z 0. We have identified five regions of the sky where the foreground median RM is consistently less than 1 rad m–2 over several degrees. These holes in the foreground RM will be useful for future studies of possible small-scale fluctuations in cosmic magnetic field structures. In addition to allowing measurement of RMs toward polarized sources, the new analysis of the NVSS data removes the effects of bandwidth depolarization for {\textbar}RM{\textbar} ≳ 100 rad m–2 inherent in the original NVSS source catalog. This new catalog of RMs and polarized flux densities is available online, and will be a valuable resource for further studies of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetoionic medium, and extragalactic magnetic fields.},

The redshifts are assumed to be cosmological. The distribution in space is found to be strongly non-uniform. The space density, in co-moving coordinates, is increasing with redshift z, such that at z = 1 the density is around 150 and 80 times the local (z = 0) density, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively. This density increase corresponds to a N(S) relation quite {\textasciitilde}imi1ar to that exhibited by extragalactic radio sources. The optical luminosity function is relatively flat, i e., the numbers per magnitude depend little on the luminosity In contrast the radio luminosity function is rather steep, the number per magnitude increas- ing toward fainter radio luminosities by a factor of around three to four per magnitude. Extension of this radio luminosity function by 1{\textasciitilde} magnitude is sufficient to account for the Sandage-Luyten estimate of the sky density of quasi-stellar objects. The local (z = 0) density of quasi-stellar objects can then be estimated at 7 X 1O{\textasciitilde} and 12 X 1O-{\textasciitilde} Mpc3, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively.

We use a general-purpose, polarization model-fitting procedure that describes the Faraday rotation measure (RM) and intrinsic polarization structure of up to three distinct polarized emission regions or `RM components' of a source. Overall, 37 per cent/52 per cent/11 per cent of sources are best fitted by one/two/three RM components. However, these fractions are dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in polarization (more RM components more likely at higher S/N). In general, our analysis shows that sources with high integrated degrees of polarization at 1.4 GHz have low Faraday depolarization, are typically dominated by a single RM component, have a steep spectral index and have a high intrinsic degree of polarization. After classifying our sample into radiative-mode and jet-mode AGN, we find no significant difference between the Faraday rotation or Faraday depolarization properties of jet-mode and radiative-mode AGN. However, there is a statistically significant difference in the intrinsic degree of polarization between the two types, with the jet-mode sources having more intrinsically ordered magnetic field structures than the radiative-mode sources. We also find a preferred perpendicular orientation of the intrinsic magnetic field structure of jet-mode AGN with respect to the jet direction, while no clear preference is found for the radiative-mode sources.},

Manifold learning is an emerging field for learning the underlying structure. The study of manifold learning can be split into two main branches, namely dimension reduction and manifold fitting. With the aim of interacting statistics and geometry, we tackle the problem of manifold fitting in the ambient space. Inspired by the relation between the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the geometry of a manifold, we aim to find a small set of points that preserve the geometry of the underlying manifold. Based on this relationship, we extend the idea of subsampling to noisy datasets in high dimensional space and utilize the Moving Least Squares (MLS) approach to approximate the underlying manifold. We analyze the two core steps in our proposed method theoretically and also provide the bounds for the MLS approach. Our simulation results and real data analysis demonstrate the superiority of our method in estimating the underlying manifold from noisy data.},

Quantifying uncertainty is especially critical in real-world settings, which often involve input distributions that are shifted from the training distribution due to a variety of factors including sample bias and non-stationarity. In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted. Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous large-scale empirical comparison of these methods under dataset shift. We present a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art methods on classification problems and investigate the effect of dataset shift on accuracy and calibration. We find that traditional post-hoc calibration does indeed fall short, as do several other previous methods.

	abstract = {With the advent of large scale-surveys the manual analysis and classification of individual radio source morphologies is rendered impossible as existing approaches do not scale. The analysis of complex morphological features in the spatial domain is a particularly important task. Here, we discuss the challenges of transferring crowdsourced labels obtained from the Radio Galaxy Zoo project and introduce a proper transfer mechanism via quantile random forest regression. By using parallelized rotation and flipping invariant Kohonen-maps, image cubes of Radio Galaxy Zoo selected galaxies formed from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) radio continuum and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) infrared all-sky surveys are first projected down to a two-dimensional embedding in an unsupervised way. This embedding can be seen as a discretized space of shapes with the coordinates reflecting morphological features as expressed by the automatically derived prototypes. We find that these prototypes have reconstructed physically meaningful processes across two channel images at radio and infrared wavelengths in an unsupervised manner. In the second step, images are compared with those prototypes to create a heat map, which is the morphological fingerprint of each object and the basis for transferring the user generated labels. These heat maps have reduced the feature space by a factor of 248, and are able to be used as the basis for subsequent machine-learning (ML) methods. Using an ensemble of decision trees we achieve upwards of 85.7\% and 80.7\% accuracy when predicting the number of components and peaks in an image, respectively, using these heat maps. We also question the currently used discrete classification schema and introduce a continuous scale that better reflects the uncertainty in transition between two classes, caused by sensitivity and resolution limits.},

	abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 μm map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 μm data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 μm map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 μm DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 μm flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 μm map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} sr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at 140 μm and of 17 +/- 4 nW m{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} sr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at 240 μm (95\% confidence). This integrated flux {\textasciitilde}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 μm emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

First we quantify the degradation of performance of a predictor which is designed for a particular spectral density function and then it is used to predict the values of a random process having a different spectral density. The logarithm of the ratio between the variance of the error, over the corresponding minimal (optimal) variance, produces a measure of distance between the two power spectra with several desirable properties. Analogous quantities based on smoothing problems produce alternative distances and suggest a class of measures based on fractions of generalized means of ratios of power spectral densities. These distance measures endow the manifold of spectral density functions with a (pseudo) Riemannian metric. We pursue one of the possible options for a distance measure, characterize the relevant geodesics, and compute corresponding distances.},

rest-frame in which the corresponding polarized emission or Faraday rotation is produced. Motivated by this requirement, we present a catalog of multiwavelength linear polarization and total intensity radio data for polarized sources from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey. We cross-match these sources with a number of complementary
measurements—combining data from major radio polarization and
total intensity surveys such as AT20G, B3-VLA, GB6, NORTH6CM, Texas, and WENSS, together with other polarization data published over the last 50 years. For 951 sources, we present spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in both fractional polarization and total intensity, each containing between 3 and 56 independent measurements from 400 MHz to 100 GHz. We physically model these SEDs, and where available provide the redshift of the optical counterpart. For a superset of 25,649 sources we provide the total intensity spectral index, α. Objects with steep versus flat α generally have different polarization SEDs: steep-spectrum
sources exhibit depolarization, while flat-spectrum sources maintain constant polarized fractions over large ranges in wavelength. This suggests the run of polarized fraction with wavelength is predominantly affected by the local source environment, rather than by unrelated foreground magnetoionic material. In addition, a significant fraction (21\%) of sources exhibit "repolarization," which further suggests that polarized SEDs are affected by different emitting regions within the source, rather than by a particular depolarization law. This has implications for the physical interpretation of future broadband polarimetric surveys.},

bright ({\textgreater}1 Jy), strongly polarized, unresolved radio-loud quasars.
The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) was used to observe these
sources with 2 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth from 1.1 to 3.1 GHz. This
allowed us to spectrally resolve the polarization structure of spatially
unresolved radio sources, and by fitting various Faraday rotation models
to the data, we conclusively demonstrate that two of the sources cannot
be described by a simple rotation measure (RM) component modified by
depolarization from a foreground Faraday screen. Our results have
important implications for using background extragalactic radio sources
as probes of the Galactic and intergalactic magneto-ionic media as we
show how RM estimations from narrow-bandwidth observations can give
erroneous results in the presence of multiple interfering Faraday
components. We postulate that the additional RM components arise from
polarized structure in the compact inner regions of the radio source
itself and not from polarized emission from galactic or intergalactic
foreground regions. We further suggest that this may contribute
significantly to any RM time variability seen in RM studies on these
angular scales. Follow-up, high-sensitivity very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) observations of these sources will directly test
our predictions.},

	abstract = {We have observed 37 bright, polarized radio sources with the Allen 
Telescope Array (ATA) to present a novel analysis of their Faraday
rotation properties. Each source was observed during the commissioning
phase with two to four 100 MHz bands at frequencies ranging from 1 to 2
GHz. These observations demonstrate how the continuous frequency
coverage of the ATA's log-periodic receiver can be applied to the study
of Faraday rotation measures (RMs). We use RM synthesis to show that
wide-bandwidth data can find multiple RM components toward a single
source. Roughly a quarter of the sources studied have extra RM
components with high confidence (brighter than ≈40 mJy), when
observing with an RM resolution of roughly 100 rad m-2. These
extra components contribute 10\%-70\% of the total polarized flux. This is
the first time multiple RM components have been identified in a large
sample of point sources. For our observing configuration, these extra RM
components bias the measurement of the peak RM by 10-15 rad
m-2 more generally, the peak RM cannot be determined more
precisely than the RM beam size. Comparing our 1-2 GHz RM spectra to
Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) polarimetric maps shows that both
techniques can identify complicated Faraday structures in the sources.
However, the RM values and fractional polarization are generally smaller
at lower frequencies than in the higher frequency VLBA maps. With a few
exceptions, the RMs from this work are consistent with that of earlier,
narrow-bandwidth, all-sky surveys. This work also describes the
polarimetry calibration procedure and that on-axis ATA observations of
linear polarization can be calibrated to an accuracy of 0.2\% of Stokes
I. Future research directions include studying the time-dependent RM
structure in active galactic nuclei and enabling accurate, wide-area RM
surveys to test models of Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields.},

We present a new theorem which shows that “Bregman distortions” (employing a potentially non-convex generator) may be exactly re-written as a scaled Bregman divergence computed over transformed data. This property can be viewed from the standpoints of geometry (a scaled isometry with adaptive metrics) or convex optimization (relating generalized perspective transforms). Admissible distortions include geodesic distances on curved manifolds and projections or gauge-normalisation. Our theorem allows one to leverage to the wealth and convenience of Bregman divergences when analysing algorithms relying on the aforementioned Bregman distortions. We illustrate this with three novel applications of our theorem: a reduction from multi-class density ratio to class-probability estimation, a new adaptive projection free yet norm-enforcing dual norm mirror descent algorithm, and a reduction from clustering on ﬂat manifolds to clustering on curved manifolds. Experiments on each of these domains validate the analyses and suggest that the scaled Bregman theorem might be a worthy addition to the popular handful of Bregman divergence properties that have been pervasive in machine learning.},

As a complement to the growing literature on spectral design of covariance kernels, the core of our proposal is to model power spectral densities through a rectangular function, which results in a kernel based on the sinc function with straightforward extensions to non-centred (around zero frequency) and frequency-varying cases. In addition to its use in regression, the relationship between the sinc kernel and the classic theory is illuminated, in particular, the Shannon-Nyquist theorem is interpreted as posterior reconstruction under the proposed kernel. Additionally, we show that the sinc kernel is instrumental in two fundamental signal processing applications: ﬁrst, in stereo amplitude modulation, where the non-centred sinc kernel arises naturally. Second, for band-pass ﬁltering, where the proposed kernel allows for a Bayesian treatment that is robust to observation noise and missing data. The developed theory is complemented with illustrative graphic examples and validated experimentally using real-world data.},

	abstract = {Computing accurate estimates of the Fourier transform of analog signals from discrete data points is important in many fields of science and engineering. The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals.},

	abstract = {A Gaussian convolution kernel K is deduced as a Green’s function of a Lie operator series. The deconvolution of a Gaussian kernel is developed by the inverse Green’s function K−1. A practical application is the deconvolution of measured proﬁles Dm(x) of photons and protons with ﬁnite detector size to determine the proﬁles Dp(x) of point-detectors or Monte Carlo Bragg curves of protons. The presented algorithms work if Dm(x) is either an analytical function or only given in a numerical form. Some approximation methods of the deconvolution are compared (differential operator expansion to analytical adaptations of 2 × 2 cm2 and 4 ×4 cm2 proﬁles, Hermite expansions to measured 6 × 6 cm2 and 20 × 20 cm2 proﬁles and Bragg curves of 80/180 MeV protons, FFT to an analytical 4 × 4 cm2 proﬁle). The inverse problem may imply ill-posed problems, and, in particular, the use of FFT may be susceptible to them.},

As in the Pade method rational functions are used with coeﬃcients determined from the powers series, but now also asymptotic expansions are also used simultaneously with that series, and consequently the rational functions have to be combined with elementary functions, in such a way, that the approach is a bridge between both expansions. The approximation now found is a rational function combined with a hyperbolic function. Only three parameters are needed to obtain a relative error smaller than 0.6 percent.},

The method takes advantage of the excellent spectral coverage provided by modern radio telescopes to reconstruct the intrinsic polarization properties along a line of sight, using a Fourier relationship between the observed polarization products and a function describing the intrinsic polarization (the Faraday dispersion function). An important consequence of the Fourier relationship and discrete frequency sampling is the need, in some cases, to deconvolve the sampling response from the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function. Practical aspects of the deconvolution procedure are discussed. We illustrate the use of the technique by summarizing a recent investigation carried out with the WSRT. We conclude by brieﬂy describing the applicability to future programs which will be carried out with the next generation of radio telescopes such as LOFAR.},

The prior estimate can be viewed as a means of shaping the spectral estimator. Cross-entropy minimization yields a family of shaped spectral estimators consistent with known autocorrelations.

In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular among astronomers, and are now used for a wide variety of tasks. In light of these developments, and the promise and challenges associated with them, the IAC Winter School 2018 focused on big data in Astronomy, with a particular emphasis on machine learning and deep learning techniques. This document summarizes the topics of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms presented during the school, and provides practical information on the application of such tools to astronomical datasets. In this document I cover basic topics in supervised machine learning, including selection and preprocessing of the input dataset, evaluation methods, and three popular supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and shallow Artiﬁcial Neural Networks. My main focus is on unsupervised machine learning algorithms, that are used to perform cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and outlier detection. Unsupervised learning algorithms are of particular importance to scientiﬁc research, since they can be used to extract new knowledge from existing datasets, and can facilitate new discoveries.},

	abstract = {The optimal source-ﬁnding strategy for linear polarization data is an unsolved problem, with many inhibitive factors imposed by the technically challenging nature of polarization observations. Such an algorithm is essential for Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathﬁnder surveys, such as the Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), as data volumes are signiﬁcant enough to prohibit manual inspection. We present a new strategy of ‘Faraday Moments’ for source-ﬁnding in linear polarization with LOFAR, using the moments of the frequency-dependent full-Stokes data (i.e. the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess kurtosis). Through simulations of the sky, we ﬁnd that moments can identify polarized sources with a high completeness: 98.5 per cent at a signal to noise of 5. While the method has low reliability, rotation measure (RM) synthesis can be applied per candidate source to ﬁlter out instrumental and spurious detections. This combined strategy will result in a complete and reliable catalogue of polarized sources that includes the full sensitivity of the observational bandwidth. We ﬁnd that the technique can reduce the number of pixels on which RM Synthesis needs to be performed by a factor of ≈1 × 105 for source distributions anticipated with modern radio telescopes. Through tests on LOFAR data, we ﬁnd that the technique works effectively in the presence of diffuse emission. Extensions of this method are directly applicable to other upcoming radio surveys such as the POlarization Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism with the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathﬁnder, and the SKA itself.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian recursion relations which describe the behavior of the a posteriori probability density function of the state of a time-discrete stochastic system conditioned on available measurement data cannot generally be solved in closed-form when the system is either non-linear or nongaussian. In this paper a density approximation involving convex combinations of gaussian density functions is introduced and proposed as a meaningful way of circumventing the difficulties encountered in evaluating these relations and in using the resulting densities to determine specific estimation policies. It is seen that as the number of terms in the gaussian sum increases without bound, the approximation converges uniformly to any density function in a large class. Further, any finite sum is itself a valid density function unlike many other approximations that have been investigated. The problem of determining the a posteriori density and minimum variance estimates for linear systems with nongaussian noise is treated using the gaussian sum approximation. This problem is considered because it can be dealt with in a relatively straightforward manner using the approximation but still contains most of the difficulties that one encounters in considering non-linear systems since the a posteriori density is nongaussian. After discussing the general problem from the point-of-view of applying gaussian sums, a numerical example is presented in which the actual statistics of the a posteriori density are compared with the values predicted by the gaussian sum and by the Kalman filter approximations.
Résumé
Les relations recurrentes bayesiennes qui décrivent le comportement de la fonction de densité de probabilité a posteriori de l'état d'un système aléatoire, discret dans le temps, en se basant sur les données des mesures disponibles, ne peuvent être généralement resolues sous une forme fermee lorsque le système est soit non-linéaire, soit non-gaussien. Le present article introduit et propose une approximation de densité, mettant en jeu des combinaisons convexes de fonctions de densité gaussiennes, à titre de méthode efficace pour éviter les difficultes rencontrées dans l'évaluation de ces relations et dans l'utilisation des densités en résultant pour determiner des stratégies d'évaluation particulières. Il est montré que, lorsque le nombre de termes de la somme gaussienne augmente sans limites, l'approximation converge uniformement vers une fonction de densité quelconque dans une catégorie étendue. De plus, toute somme finie est ellemême une fonction de densité valable, d'une manière différente des nombreuses autres approximations étudiées dans le passé. Le problème de la determination des estimations de la densité a posteriori et de la variance minimale pour des systèmes linéaires avec bruit non-gaussien est traité en utilisant l'approximation des sommes gaussiennes. Ce problème est étudié parce qu'il peut être traité d'une manière relativement simple en utilisant l'approximation mais contient encore la plupart des difficultés rencontrées en considérant des systèmes non-linéaires, puisque la densité a posteriori est non-gaussienne. Après la discussion du problème général du point de vue de l'application des sommes gaussiennes, l'article présente un exemple numérique dans lequel les statistiques réélles de la densité a posteriori sont comparées avec les valeurs prédites par les approximations des sommes gaussiennes et du filtre de Kalman.
Zusammenfassung
Die Bayes'schen Rekursionsbeziehungen, die das Verhalten der a priori-Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichtefunktion des Zustandes eines zeitdiskreten stochastischen Systems beschrieben, können nicht allgemein in geschlossener Form gelöst werden, wenn das System entweder nichtlinear oder nicht-gaussisch ist. In dieser Arbeit wird eine Dichteapproximation, die konvexe Kombinationen von Gauss'schen Dichtefunktionen enthält, eingeführt und als bedeutungsvoller Weg zur Umgehung der Schwierigkeiten vorgeschlagen, die sich bei der Auswertung dieser Beziehungen und bei der Benutzung der resultierenden Dichten ergeben, um die spezifische Schätzstrategie zu bestimmen. Ersichtlich konvergiert, da die Zahl der Terme in der Gauss'schen Summe unbegrenzt wächst, die Approximation gleichmäßig zu einer Dichtefunktion in einer umfassenden Klasse. Weiter ist eine endliche Summe selbst eine gültige Dichtefunktion, anders als viele andere schon untersuchte Approximationen. Das Problem der Bestimmung der Schätzungen der a posteriori-Dichte und des Varianzminimums für lineare Systeme mit nichtgauss'schem Geräusch wird unter Behandlung der Gauss'schen Summenapproximation behandelt. Dieses Problem wird betrachtet, weil es in einer relativ geraden Art unter Benutzung der Approximation behandelt werden kann, aber immer noch die meisten der Schwierigkeiten enthält, denen man bei der Betrachtung nichtlinearer Systeme begegnet, da die a posteriori-Dichte nichtgaussisch ist. Nach der Diskussion des allgemeinen Problems vom Gesichtspunkt der Anwendung Gauss'scher Summen, wird ein Zahlenbeispiel gebracht, in dem die aktuellen Statistiken der a posteriori-Dichte mit den Werten verglichen werde, die durch die Gauss'sche Summe und durch die Kalman-Filter-Approximationen vorhergesagt wurden.

	abstract = {Signal classification is an important issue in many branches of science and engineering. In signal classification, a feature of the signals is often selected for similarity comparison. A distance metric must then be established to measure the dissimilarities between different signal features. Due to the natural characteristics of dynamic systems, the power spectral density (PSD) of a signal is often used as a feature to facilitate classification. We reason in this paper that PSD matrices have structural constraints and that they describe a manifold in the signal space. Thus, instead of the widely used Euclidean distance (ED), a more appropriate measure is the Riemannian distance (RD) on the manifold. Here, we develop closed-form expressions of the RD between two PSD matrices on the manifold and study some of the properties. We further show how an optimum weighting matrix can be developed for the application of RD to signal classification. These new distance measures are then applied to the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for the determination of sleep states and the results are highly encouraging.},

	abstract = {Methods. We match radio emission from the NVSS and SUMSS surveys to galaxies of the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS) using an image-level algorithm that properly treats the extended structure of radio sources.
Results. The bright master sample we present contains 575 radio-emitting galaxies with a ﬂux greater than 213 mJy at 1.4 GHz. Over 30\% of the galaxies in our catalog are not contained in existing large-area extra-galactic radio samples. We compute the optical and radio luminosity functions and the fraction of radio galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity. 94\% of the radio galaxies within z = 0.03 are of Hubble type E/S0. The local galaxy density in a sphere of 2 Mpc centered on the radio galaxies is 1.7 times higher than around non-radio galaxies of the same luminosity and morphology, which is a statistically signiﬁcant enhancement ({\textgreater}3σ).
Conclusions. Our sample presents the deepest all-sky catalog of low-power radio galaxies. The observed enhancement of the galaxy density around radio galaxies suggests a causal relation between external galaxy properties, such as environment or merger history, and the formation of powerful jets in the present universe. Since the enhancement is observed with respect to galaxies of the same luminosity and Hubble type, it is not primarily driven by black hole mass. Our automated matching procedure is found to select radio-emitting galaxies with high eﬃciency (99\%) and purity (91\%), which is key for future processing of deeper, larger samples.},

Although separating AGN from star-forming galaxies remains challenging, the combination of spectroscopic and photometric techniques we used gives us one of the largest available samples of candidate RLAGN. We used the sample, combined with recently developed analytical models, to investigate the lifetime distribution of RLAGN. We show that large or giant powerful RLAGN are probably the old tail of the general RLAGN population, but that the low-luminosity RLAGN candidates in our sample, many of which have sizes {\textless}100 kpc, either require a very diﬀerent lifetime distribution or have diﬀerent jet physics from the more powerful objects. We then used analytical models to develop a method of estimating jet kinetic powers for our candidate objects and constructed a jet kinetic luminosity function based on these estimates. These values can be compared to observational quantities, such as the integrated radiative luminosity of groups and clusters, and to the predictions from models of RLAGN feedback in galaxy formation and evolution. In particular, we show that RLAGN in the local Universe are able to supply all the energy required per comoving unit volume to counterbalance X-ray radiative losses from groups and clusters and thus prevent the hot gas from cooling. Our computation of the kinetic luminosity density of local RLAGN is in good agreement with other recent observational estimates and with models of galaxy formation.},

We show that neglecting various loss processes can introduce a systematic bias in the jet powers inferred from radio luminosities for a sample of radio galaxies. This bias can be corrected for by considering source size as well as radio luminosity; effectively the source size acts as a proxy for source age. Based on a sample of Fanaroff–Riley Type II radio sources with jet powers derived from the measured hotspot parameters, we empirically determine a new expression for jet power that accounts for the source size, (Qjet/1036 W) = 1.5+−10..88(L151/1027 W Hz−1)0.8(1 + z)1.0(D/kpc)0.58±0.17, where D is source size and L151 the 151 MHz radio luminosity. By comparing a ﬂux-limited and volume-limited sample, we show that any derived radio-luminosity–jet-power relation depends sensitively on sample properties, in particular the source size distribution and the size–luminosity correlation inherent in the sample. Such bias will affect the accuracy of the kinetic luminosity function derived from lobe radio luminosities and should be treated with caution.},

Our results are motivated by recent applications of minimum Wasserstein estimators to complex generative models. We discuss some difﬁculties arising in the approximation of these estimators and illustrate their behavior in several numerical experiments.

which have typical stellar masses within 3 × (1010 -
1011)M⊙, and 3 GHz radio data in the COSMOS
field, we derived the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions for radio AGN
(L1.4 GHz 1022 - 1027 W
Hz-1) out to z 5. We constrained the evolution of this
population via continuous models of pure density and pure luminosity
evolutions, and we found best-fit parametrizations of
Φ∗ ∝ (1 + z)(2.00 ± 0.18) - (0.60
± 0.14)z, and L∗ ∝ (1 + z)(2.88
± 0.82) - (0.84 ± 0.34)z, respectively, with a
turnover in number and luminosity densities of the population at z ≈
1.5. We converted 1.4 GHz luminosity to kinetic luminosity taking
uncertainties of the scaling relation used into account. We thereby
derived the cosmic evolution of the kinetic luminosity density provided
by the AGN and compared this luminosity density to the radio-mode AGN
feedback assumed in the Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) model,
I.e., to the redshift evolution of the central supermassive black hole
accretion luminosity taken in the model as the source of heating that
offsets the energy losses of the cooling, hot halo gas, and thereby
limits further stellar mass growth of massive galaxies. We find that the
kinetic luminosity exerted by our radio AGN may be high enough to
balance the radiative cooling of the hot gas at each cosmic epoch since
z 5. However, although our findings support the idea of radio-mode AGN
feedback as a cosmologically relevant process in massive galaxy
formation, many simplifications in both the observational and
semi-analytic approaches still remain and need to be resolved before
robust conclusions can be reached.},

cross-comparing the data from the first data release (DR1) of the LOFAR
Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
DR7 main galaxy spectroscopic sample. The LoTSS DR1 provides deep data
(median rms noise of 71 μJy at 150 MHz) over 424 square degrees of
sky, which is sufficient to detect 10 615 (32 per cent) of the SDSS
galaxies over this sky area. An improved method to separate active
galactic nuclei (AGN) accurately from sources with radio emission
powered by star formation (SF) is developed and applied, leading to a
sample of 2121 local (z {\textless} 0.3) radio AGN. The local 150 MHz
luminosity function is derived for radio AGN and SF galaxies separately,
and the good agreement with previous studies at 1.4 GHz suggests that
the separation method presented is robust. The prevalence of radio AGN
activity is confirmed to show a strong dependence on both stellar and
black hole masses, remarkably reaching a fraction of 100 per cent of the
most massive galaxies ({\textgreater} 1011 M⊙)
displaying radio-AGN activity with L150 MHz ≥
1021 W Hz-1; thus, the most massive galaxies are
always switched on at some level. The results allow the full
Eddington-scaled accretion rate distribution (a proxy for the duty
cycle) to be probed for massive galaxies, and this accretion rate is
found to peak at Lmech/LEdd ≈ 10-5.
More than 50 per cent of the energy is released during the ≤2 per
cent of the time spent at the highest accretion rates,
Lmech/LEdd {\textgreater} 10-2.5. Stellar mass is
shown to be a more important driver of radio-AGN activity than black
hole mass, suggesting a possible connection between the fuelling gas and
the surrounding halo. This result is in line with models in which these
radio AGN are essential for maintaining the quenched state of galaxies
at the centres of hot gas haloes.},

distribution rather than a vector embedding. In particular, this distribution
is supported over the contexts which co-occur with the entity and are embedded

learning from the perspective of Optimal Transport and take advantage of its
tools such as Wasserstein distance and barycenters. We elaborate how the method
can be applied for obtaining unsupervised representations of text and
illustrate the performance (quantitatively as well as qualitatively) on tasks
such as measuring sentence similarity, word entailment and similarity, where we
empirically observe significant gains (e.g., 4.1\% relative improvement over
Sent2vec, GenSen).
  The key benefits of the proposed approach include: (a) capturing uncertainty
and polysemy via modeling the entities as distributions, (b) utilizing the
underlying geometry of the particular task (with the ground cost), (c)
simultaneously providing interpretability with the notion of optimal transport

It begins with an overview of the basic principles of radio astronomy, a short history of the development of radio interferometry, and an elementary discussion of the operation of an interferometer. From this foundation, it delves into the underlying relationships of interferometry, sets forth the coordinate systems and parameters to describe synthesis imaging, and examines configurations of antennas for multielement synthesis arrays. Various aspects of the design and response of receiving systems are discussed, as well as the special requirements of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), image reconstruction, and recent developments in image enhancement techniques and astrometric observations. Also discussed are propagation effects in the media between the source and the observer, and radio interference, factors that limit performance. Related techniques are introduced, including intensity interferometry, optical interferometry, lunar occultations, tracking of satellites in Earth orbit, interferometry for remote Earth sensing, and holographic measurements of antenna surfaces. This book will benefit anyone who is interested in radio interferometry techniques for astronomy, astrometry, geodesy, or electrical engineering.},

The discussion begins with first principles, physically motivating and deriving all results rather than merely presenting finished formulas. Much of the prerequisite material is provided by brief reviews, making the book a self-contained reference tool.

	abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary Universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies with their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be divided into two distinct populations. The radiative-mode AGNs are associated with black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ∼1\% of the Eddington limit. They are primarily associated with less massive BHs growing in high-density pseudobulges at a rate sufﬁcient to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in ∼10 Gyr. The circumnuclear environment contains high-density cold gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outﬂows (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in their host bulge is signiﬁcant today. These AGNs are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still at play today.},

Kilometre Array precursor located in Western Australia, we have
completed the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, and
present the resulting extragalactic catalogue, utilizing the first year
of observations. The catalogue covers 24 831 square degrees, over
declinations south of +30° and Galactic latitudes outside 10° of
the Galactic plane, excluding some areas such as the Magellanic Clouds.
It contains 307 455 radio sources with 20 separate flux density
measurements across 72-231 MHz, selected from a time- and
frequency-integrated image centred at 200 MHz, with a resolution of
≈2 arcmin. Over the catalogued region, we estimate that the catalogue
is 90 per cent complete at 170 mJy, and 50 per cent complete at 55 mJy,
and large areas are complete at even lower flux density levels. Its
reliability is 99.97 per cent above the detection threshold of 5σ,
which itself is typically 50 mJy. These observations constitute the
widest fractional bandwidth and largest sky area survey at radio
frequencies to date, and calibrate the low-frequency flux density scale
of the southern sky to better than 10 per cent. This paper presents
details of the flagging, imaging, mosaicking and source
extraction/characterization, as well as estimates of the completeness
and reliability. All source measurements and images are available

	abstract = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical
properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to
different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by
relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible
connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become
available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field. (SECTION: Invited Review Paper)},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in developing diagnostics that discriminate individual mutagenic mechanisms in a range of applications that include identifying population-specific mutagenesis and resolving distinct mutation signatures in cancer samples. Analyses for these applications assume that mutagenic mechanisms have a distinct relationship with neighboring bases that allows them to be distinguished. Direct support for this assumption is limited to a small number of simple cases, e.g., CpG hypermutability. We have evaluated whether the mechanistic origin of a point mutation can be resolved using only sequence context for a more complicated case. We contrasted single nucleotide variants originating from the multitude of mutagenic processes that normally operate in the mouse germline with those induced by the potent mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). The considerable overlap in the mutation spectra of these two samples make this a challenging problem. Employing a new, robust log-linear modeling method, we demonstrate that neighboring bases contain information regarding point mutation direction that differs between the ENU-induced and spontaneous mutation variant classes. A logistic regression classifier exhibited strong performance at discriminating between the different mutation classes. Concordance between the feature set of the best classifier and information content analyses suggest our results can be generalized to other mutation classification problems. We conclude that machine learning can be used to build a practical classification tool to identify the mutation mechanism for individual genetic variants.

	abstract = {We have discovered a previously unreported poor cluster of galaxies 
(RGZ-CL J0823.2+0333) through an unusual giant wide-angle tail radio
galaxy found in the Radio Galaxy Zoo project. We obtained a
spectroscopic redshift of z = 0.0897 for the E0-type host galaxy, 2MASX
J08231289+0333016, leading to Mr = -22.6 and a 1.4 GHz radio
luminosity density of L1.4 = 5.5 × 1024 W
Hz-1. These radio and optical luminosities are typical for
wide-angle tailed radio galaxies near the borderline between
Fanaroff-Riley classes I and II. The projected largest angular size of
≈8 arcmin corresponds to 800 kpc and the full length of the source
along the curved jets/trails is 1.1 Mpc in projection. X-ray data from
the XMM-Newton archive yield an upper limit on the X-ray luminosity of
the thermal emission surrounding RGZ J082312.9+033301 at 1.2-2.6 ×
1043 erg s-1 for assumed intracluster medium
temperatures of 1.0-5.0 keV. Our analysis of the environment surrounding
RGZ J082312.9+033301 indicates that RGZ J082312.9+033301 lies within a
poor cluster. The observed radio morphology suggests that (a) the host
galaxy is moving at a significant velocity with respect to an ambient

previous studies. In the FR-II sample, we compare the degree of
asymmetry in radio lobe properties to asymmetry in the radio source
environment, quantified through optical galaxy clustering. We find that
the length of radio lobes in FR-II sources is anticorrelated with both
galaxy clustering and lobe luminosity. These results are in quantitative
agreement with predictions from radio source dynamical models and
suggest that galaxy clustering provides a useful proxy for the ambient
gas density distribution encountered by the radio lobes.},

The magnetic field lines follow the contours of total intensity and are either parallel or perpendicular to ridge lines. This behavior can be explained by a model in which the field is aligned by the shear and compression of a
supersonic jet excavating a cavity in a much denser medium. There tend to be larger variations in RM in the most luminous sources. At high Galactic latitudes the RM structure is on scales comparable with the beam (typically 5 arcsec). RM variations are usually larger on the brighter side of the source.},

A total of 87\% of the sample lies within a projected 15 Mpc of an optically identified cluster. Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are more likely than other cluster members to be radio sources, and are also moderately bent. The surface density as a function of separation from cluster center of non-BCG radio galaxies follows a power law with index -1.10 ±
0.03 out to 10 r 500 (∼7 Mpc), which is steeper than the corresponding distribution for optically selected galaxies. Non-BCG radio galaxies are statistically more bent the closer they are to the cluster center. Within the inner 1.5 r 500 (∼1 Mpc) of a cluster, non-BCG radio galaxies are statistically more bent in high-mass clusters than in low-mass clusters. Together, we find that non-BCG sources are statistically more bent in environments that exert greater ram pressure. We use the orientation of bent radio galaxies as an indicator of galaxy orbits and find that they are preferentially in radial orbits. Away from clusters, there is a large population of bent radio galaxies, limiting their use as cluster locators; however, they are still located within statistically overdense regions. We investigate the asymmetry in the tail length of sources that have their tails aligned along the radius vector from the cluster center, and find that the length of the inward-pointing tail is weakly suppressed for sources close to the center of the cluster.},

Using this classiﬁcation we identify a few distinguishing host galaxy properties of each class, which, along with the emission line analysis, suggest continuous evolution from one class to another.

	abstract = {The recent development of unified theories of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has indicated that there are two physically distinct classes of these objects--radio-loud and radio-quiet. Despite differences, the (probable) thermal emissions from the AGNs (continua and lines from X-ray to infrared wavelengths) are quite similar to the two classes of object. We argue that this last result suggests that the black hole masses and mass accretion rates in the two classes are not greatly different, and that the difference between the classes is associated with the spin of the black hole. We assume that the normal process of accretion through a disk does not lead to rapidly spinning holes and propose that galaxies (e.g., spirals) which have not suffered a recent major merger event contain nonrotating or only slowly rotating black holes. When two such galaxies merge, the two black holes are known to form a binary and we assume that they eventually coalesce. The ratio of the number of radio-loud to radio-quiet AGNs at a given thermal (e.g., optical) luminosity is determined by the galaxy merger rate. Comparisons between the predicted and observed radio luminosity functions constrain the efficiencies with which jet power is extracted from the spinning hole and radio emission is produced by the jet.},

By comparing the 8–1000 lm IR, which samples dustreprocessed starlight, with direct stellar FUV emission, I show that the IR traces most of the SF in luminous \$L* galaxies but traces only a small fraction of the SF in faint \$0.01L* galaxies. If radio emission were a perfect SF rate indicator, this eﬀect would cause easily detectable curvature in the radio-IR correlation. Yet, the radio-IR correlation is nearly linear. This implies that the radio ﬂux from low-luminosity galaxies is substantially suppressed, compared to brighter galaxies. This is naturally interpreted in terms of a decreasing eﬃciency of nonthermal radio emission in faint galaxies. Thus, the linearity of the radio-IR correlation is a conspiracy: both indicators underestimate the SF rate at low luminosities. SF rate calibrations that take into account this eﬀect are presented, along with estimates of the random and systematic error associated with their use.},

the range 72-231MHz. These observations constitute the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey, and we use the extragalactic catalogue (EGC) (Galactic latitude, \${\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ ) to define the GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample. This is a complete sample of the `brightest' radio sources ( \$S\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{151 MHz\}\}{\textgreater}4 Jy\$ ), the majority of which are active galactic nuclei with powerful radio jets. Crucially,
low-frequency observations allow the selection of such sources in an orientation-independent way (i.e. minimising the bias caused by Doppler boosting, inherent in high-frequency surveys). We then use
higher-resolution radio images, and information at other wavelengths, to morphologically classify the brightest components in GLEAM. We also conduct cross-checks against the literature and perform internal matching, in order to improve sample completeness (which is estimated to be \${\textgreater}95.5\$ \%). This results in a catalogue of 1863 sources, making the G4Jy Sample over 10 times larger than that of the revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3CRR; \$S\_\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textrm\{\vphantom{\}}178
MHz\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}{\textgreater}10.9 Jy\$ ). Of these G4Jy sources, 78 are resolved by the MWA (Phase-I) synthesised beam ( \$∼2\$ arcmin at 200MHz), and we label 67\% of the sample as `single', 26\% as `double', 4\% as `triple', and 3\% as having `complex' morphology at \$∼1 GHz\$ (45 arcsec resolution). We characterise the spectral behaviour of these objects in the radio and find that the median spectral index is \$α=-0.740 ± 0.012\$
between 151 and 843MHz, and \$α=-0.786 ± 0.006\$ between
151MHz and 1400MHz (assuming a power-law description, \$S\_\{ν\} ∝
ν{\textasciicircum}\{α\}\$ ), compared to \$α=-0.829 ± 0.006\$ within
the GLEAM band. Alongside this, our value-added catalogue provides mid-infrared source associations (subject to 6" resolution at 3.4 \$μ\$ m) for the radio emission, as identified through visual inspection and thorough checks against the literature. As such, the G4Jy Sample can be used as a reliable training set for cross-identification via
machine-learning algorithms. We also estimate the angular size of the sources, based on their associated components at \$∼1 GHz\$ , and
perform a flux density comparison for 67 G4Jy sources that overlap with 3CRR. Analysis of multi-wavelength data, and spectral curvature between 72MHz and 20GHz, will be presented in subsequent papers, and details for accessing all G4Jy overlays are provided at https://github.com/svw26/G4Jy.},

the `brightest' radio-sources ( \$S\_\{151 MHz\}{\textgreater}4\$ Jy) in the
extragalactic catalogue (Galactic latitude, \${\textbar}b{\textbar} {\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ ). We
refer to these 1 863 sources as the GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample, and use
radio images (of \$\{≤\}45\$ arcsec resolution), and multi-wavelength
information, to assess their morphology and identify the galaxy that is
hosting the radio emission (where appropriate). Details of how to access
all of the overlays used for this work are available at https://github.com/svw26/G4Jy.
Alongside this we conduct further checks against the literature, which
we document here for individual sources. Whilst the vast majority of the
G4Jy Sample are active galactic nuclei with powerful radio-jets, we
highlight that it also contains a nebula, two nearby, star-forming
galaxies, a cluster relic, and a cluster halo. There are also three
extended sources for which we are unable to infer the mechanism that
gives rise to the low-frequency emission. In the G4Jy catalogue we
provide mid-infrared identifications for 86\% of the sources, and flag
the remainder as: having an uncertain identification (129 sources),
having a faint/uncharacterised mid-infrared host (126 sources), or it
being inappropriate to specify a host (2 sources). For the subset of 129
sources, there is ambiguity concerning candidate host-galaxies, and this
includes four sources (B0424-728, B0703-451, 3C 198, and 3C 403.1) where

	abstract = {The central nuclei of galaxies, where supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are thought to reside, can experience phases of activity when they become active galactic nuclei (AGNs). An AGN can eject winds and jets and produce radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The fraction of the bolometric emission in the radio spans a factor of approximately 105 across the different classes of AGNs. The weakest radio sources, radio-quiet (RQ) AGNs, are typically 1,000 times fainter than the radio-loud (RL) AGNs, and represent the majority of the AGN population. In RQ AGNs, the absence of luminous jets allows us to probe radio emission from a wide range of possible mechanisms: star formation, AGN-driven wind, free-free emission from photoionized gas, low-power jets and the innermost accretion disk coronal activity. All these mechanisms can now be probed with unprecedented precision and spatial resolution, owing to the current and forthcoming generation of highly sensitive radio arrays.},

	abstract = {We present a multiwavelength analysis of 28 of the most luminous 
low-redshift narrow-line, ultra-hard X-ray-selected active galactic
nuclei (AGN) drawn from the 70-month Swift/BAT all-sky survey, with
bolometric luminosities of log (L\_bol /\{erg s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}) ≳ 45.25. The
broad goal of our study is to determine whether these objects have any
distinctive properties, potentially setting them aside from lower
luminosity obscured AGN in the local Universe. Our analysis relies on
the first data release of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS/DR1)
and on dedicated observations with the VLT, Palomar, and Keck
observatories. We find that the vast majority of our sources agree with
commonly used AGN selection criteria which are based on emission line
ratios and on mid-infrared colours. Our AGN are pre-dominantly hosted in
massive galaxies (9.8 ≲ log (M*/M⊙)
≲ 11.7); based on visual inspection of archival optical images,
they appear to be mostly ellipticals. Otherwise, they do not have
distinctive properties. Their radio luminosities, determined from
publicly available survey data, show a large spread of almost four
orders of magnitude - much broader than what is found for lower X-ray
luminosity obscured AGN in BASS. Moreover, our sample shows no preferred
combination of black hole masses (MBH) and/or Eddington ratio
(λEdd), covering 7.5 ≲ log
(MBH/M⊙) ≲ 10.3 and 0.01 ≲
λEdd ≲ 1. Based on the distribution of our
sources in the λEdd-NH plane, we conclude
that our sample is consistent with a scenario where the amount of
obscuring material along the line of sight is determined by radiation
pressure exerted by the AGN on the dusty circumnuclear gas.},

selection, we minimize the biases against obscured or Compton-thick AGNs
as well as confusion with emission derived from star formation that
typically affect AGN samples selected from the ultraviolet, optical and
infrared wavelengths. We find that all the objects in our sample of
nearby, ultra-hard X-ray selected AGNs are radio quiet; 83 per cent of
the objects are classed as high-excitation galaxies and 17 per cent as
low-excitation galaxies. While these low-z BAT sources follow the
radio-far-infrared correlation in a similar fashion to star-forming
galaxies, our analysis finds that there is still significant AGN
contribution in the observed radio emission from these radio-quiet AGNs.
In fact, the majority of our BAT sample occupy the same X-ray-radio
Fundamental Plane as has been observed in other samples, which include
radio-loud AGNs - evidence that the observed radio emission (albeit
weak) is connected to the AGN accretion mechanism, rather than star
formation.},

	abstract = {This proposal is a continuation of our previous observations (C2340) to complete the sample of giant radio galaxies described below. One of the key challenges today is to account for nearly half of the baryons in the present-day universe that are missing. These missing baryons are thought to pervade the moderate overdensity filaments (with fractional
overdensity {\textasciitilde}10 to 100) of the large-scale structure as a Warm-Hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) of 10{\textasciicircum}5 to 10{\textasciicircum}7 K gas. The state of the gas is a consequence of the hydrodynamic infall heating and, more
importantly, the astrophysical feedback on the environment from galaxy formation and evolution. We propose to use a sample of giant radio galaxies embedded in the filaments, with radio jets that interact with the gas beyond and outside of their host galaxy, as a probe of the WHIM. Modelling the jet-WHIM interaction and the evolution of the radio synchrotron plasma lobes in the gas and gravitational field of the surrounding large-scale structure constitutes a novel method of
constraining the physical parameters and cosmological evolution of the WHIM gas, and thereby assessing the importance of feedback from galaxy evolution on the state of this gas.},

In this paper, we examine the performance of QU-ﬁtting by simulating observations of two polarized sources located along the same LOS, varying the widths of the sources and the gap between them in Faraday depth space, systematically. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach is used to obtain the best-ﬁt parameters for a ﬁtting model, and Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria (AIC and BIC, respectively) are adopted to select the best model from four ﬁtting models. We ﬁnd that the combination of MCMC and AIC/BIC works fairly well in model selection and estimation of model parameters in the cases where two sources have relatively small widths and a larger gap in Faraday depth space. On the other hand, when two sources have large width in Faraday depth space, MCMC chain tends to be trapped in a local maximum so that AIC/BIC cannot select a correct model. We discuss the causes and the tendency of the failure of QU-ﬁtting and suggest a way to improve it.},

software package that automates the classification of the type, age,
redshift, and host galaxy of supernova spectra. DASH makes use of a new
approach that does not rely on iterative template-matching techniques
like all previous software, but instead classifies based on the learned
features of each supernova’s type and age. It has achieved this by
employing a deep convolutional neural network to train a matching
algorithm. This approach has enabled DASH to be orders of magnitude
faster than previous tools, being able to accurately classify hundreds
or thousands of objects within seconds. We have tested its performance
on 4 yr of data from the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES). The deep
learning models were developed using TensorFlow and were trained using
over 4000 supernova spectra taken from the CfA Supernova Program and the
Berkeley SN Ia Program as used in SNID (Supernova Identification
software). Unlike template-matching methods, the trained models are
independent of the number of spectra in the training data, which allows
for DASH's unprecedented speed. We have developed both a graphical
interface for easy visual classification and analysis of supernovae and
a Python library for the autonomous and quick classification of several
supernova spectra. The speed, accuracy, user-friendliness, and
versatility of DASH present an advancement to existing spectral
classification tools. We have made the code publicly available on GitHub
and PyPI (pip install astrodash) to allow for further contributions and
development. The package documentation is available at https://astrodash.readthedocs.io.},

astronomical applications over the last few years, for example in the
morphological classification of galaxies. Convolutional neural networks
have proven to be highly effective in classifying objects in image data.
In the context of radio-interferometric imaging in astronomy, we looked
for ways to identify multiple components of individual sources. To this
effect, we design a convolutional neural network to differentiate
between different morphology classes using sources from the Radio Galaxy
Zoo (RGZ) citizen science project. In this first step, we focus on
exploring the factors that affect the performance of such neural
networks, such as the amount of training data, number and nature of
layers, and the hyperparameters. We begin with a simple experiment in
which we only differentiate between two extreme morphologies, using
compact and multiple-component extended sources. We found that a
three-convolutional layer architecture yielded very good results,
achieving a classification accuracy of 97.4 per cent on a test data set.
The same architecture was then tested on a four-class problem where we
let the network classify sources into compact and three classes of
extended sources, achieving a test accuracy of 93.5 per cent. The
best-performing convolutional neural network set-up has been verified
against RGZ Data Release 1 where a final test accuracy of 94.8 per cent
was obtained, using both original and augmented images. The use of sigma
clipping does not offer a significant benefit overall, except in cases
with a small number of training images.},

However, to date, these methods have not yet been successfully applied to the analysis of long stretches of data recorded by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories. In this work, we critically examine the use of convolutional neural networks as a tool to search for merging black holes. We identify the strengths and limitations of this approach, highlight some common pitfalls in translating between machine learning and gravitational-wave astronomy, and discuss the
interdisciplinary challenges. In particular, we explain in detail why convolutional neural networks alone cannot be used to claim a
statistically significant gravitational-wave detection. However, we demonstrate how they can still be used to rapidly flag the times of potential signals in the data for a more detailed follow-up. Our convolutional neural network architecture as well as the proposed performance metrics are better suited for this task than a standard binary classifications scheme. A detailed evaluation of our approach on Advanced LIGO data demonstrates the potential of such systems as trigger generators. Finally, we sound a note of caution by constructing
adversarial examples, which showcase interesting "failure modes" of our model, where inputs with no visible resemblance to real
gravitational-wave signals are identified as such by the network with high confidence.},

	abstract = {With the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the advanced 
laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) has initiated
a new field of astronomy by providing an alternative means of sensing
the universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections
is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of
LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is
still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources
of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise
features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in
their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental
coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches
come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new
morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure
or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of
glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave
detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO.
This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we
describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine
learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the
glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse
platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize
images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified
morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the
detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to
categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of
the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both
classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of
improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The
resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO
scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate
them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate
and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these
methods using a small subset of data from LIGO’s first observing
run.},

Traditionally, the cross-matching is done by eye, but this does not scale to the millions of radio sources expected from the next generation of radio surveys. We present an innovative automated procedure, using Bayesian hypothesis testing, that models trial radio-source morphologies with putative positions of the host galaxy. This new algorithm diﬀers from an earlier version by allowing more complex radio source morphologies, and performing a simultaneous ﬁt over a large ﬁeld.

rotation and flipping INvariant Kohonen maps (PINK), a self-organizing

example of this method using 894 415 images from the Faint Images of the
Radio-Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) and Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE) surveys centred towards positions described by the FIRST
catalogue. We produce a set of catalogues that complement FIRST and
describe 802 646 objects, including their radio components and their
corresponding AllWISE infrared host galaxy. Using these data products,
we (i) demonstrate the ability to identify objects with rare and unique
radio morphologies (e.g. 'X'-shaped galaxies, hybrid FR I/FR II
morphologies), (ii) can identify the potentially resolved radio
components that are associated with a single infrared host, (iii)
introduce a 'curliness' statistic to search for bent and disturbed radio
morphologies, and (iv) extract a set of 17 giant radio galaxies between
700 and 1100 kpc. As we require no training labels, our method can be
applied to any radio-continuum survey, provided a sufficiently

	abstract = {Magnetic fields pervade the interstellar medium (ISM), but are difficult 
to detect and characterize. The new generation of low-frequency radio
telescopes, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR: a Square Kilometre
Array-low pathfinder), provides advancements in our capability of
probing Galactic magnetism through low-frequency polarimetry. Maps of
diffuse polarized radio emission and the associated Faraday rotation can
be used to infer properties of, and trace structure in, the magnetic
fields in the ISM. However, to date very little of the sky has been
probed at high angular and Faraday depth resolution. We observed a
5° by 5° region centred on the nearby galaxy IC 342 (ℓ =
138.2°,b = + 10.6°) using the LOFAR high-band antennae in the
frequency range 115-178 MHz. We imaged this region at 4'.5x3'.8
resolution and performed Faraday tomography to detect foreground
Galactic polarized synchrotron emission separated by Faraday depth
(different amounts of Faraday rotation). Our Faraday depth cube shows a
rich polarized structure, with up to 30 K of polarized emission at 150
MHz. We clearly detect two polarized features that extend over most of
the field, but are clearly separated in Faraday depth. Simulations of
the behaviour of the depolarization of Faraday-thick structures at such
low frequencies show that such structures would be too strongly
depolarized to explain the observations. These structures are therefore
rejected as the source of the observed polarized features. Only Faraday
thin structures will not be strongly depolarized at low frequencies;
producing such structures requires localized variations in the ratio of
synchrotron emissivity to Faraday depth per unit distance. Such
variations can arise from several physical phenomena, such as a
transition between regions of ionized and (mostly) neutral gas. We
conclude that the observed polarized emission is Faraday thin, and
propose that the emission originates from two mostly neutral clouds in
the local ISM. Using maps of the local ISM to estimate distances to
these clouds, we have modelled the Faraday rotation for this line of
sight and estimated that the strength of the line of sight component of
magnetic field of the local ISM for this direction varies between -0.86
and+0.12 μG (where positive is towards the Earth). We propose that
this may be a useful method for mapping magnetic fields within the local
ISM in all directions towards nearby neutral clouds.

For example, we sometimes have a classiﬁcation task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufﬁcient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classiﬁcation, regression and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as co-variate shift.

suggested by Owen [Jets in Extragalactic Radio Sources, edited by H.-J.
Roser and K. Meisenheimer (Springer, New York, 1993), p. 273], the FR
I/II division is shown to be a strong function of the optical luminosity
of the host galaxy ( is proportional to L{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum}\_opt\_). This dependence is
also seen in the bivariate luminosity function, which suggests that the
evolutionary tracks of radio sources and/or the initial conditions in
the source are governed by the host galaxy properties. The probability
for detecting radio emission increases with optical luminosity. The
optical dependence is clearly separated in the integral luminosity
functions which can be used as a constraint to models of FR I radio
power evolution. Additionally, the source counts from the integrated
univariate radio luminosity function (RLF) are consistent with our
suggestion in Paper V that radio sources may be a transient phenomenon
which occurs in all elliptical galaxies at some time (or several times)
over their lifetime. We find no statistically significant differences in
the luminosity functions between rich cluster samples and radio sources
not selected to reside in clusters. These results suggest that all radio
galaxies live in similar environments in that the optical luminosity and
the properties of the host galaxy are the most important parameters
which affect radio source formation and evolution.},

luminosity plane. A theoretical expression for the dividing line is derived on the basis that borderline class I/II sources are
characterized by (1) transonic Mach numbers and (2) more or less unique ({\textasciitilde}0.6 c) mildly relativistic velocities, consistent with deceleration of an initially moderately relativistic or ultrarelativistic jet. The deduction of a unique transonic velocity is combined with established empirical relationships between the X-ray luminosities, core radii, velocity dispersions, and absolute magnitudes of elliptical galaxies. The slope of the theoretical dividing line is well determined and agrees well with that inferred from the data. The intercept of the dividing line depends upon several parameters which are known perhaps to within factors of order unity and agrees with the data to better than an order of magnitude. As a corollary to this work, useful relationships between the source total and monochromatic luminosities and the jet energy flux are obtained.},

It is hosted by a giant elliptical with a ∼ 109 M\_⊙ multiphase gaseous
circumnuclear disc. We used high spatial resolution, adaptive
optics-assisted H- and K-band integral field Gemini/NIFS observations to probe (1) the warm (∼103 K) molecular gas phase, traced by ro-vibrational transitions of H2, and (2), the warm ionized medium, traced by the [Fe II]\_\{1.644 μ m\} line. The [Fe II] emission traces shocked gas ejected from the disc plane by a jet-blown bubble 300-400 pc in diameter, while the H2 emission traces shock-excited molecular gas in the interior ∼ 1 kpc of the
circumnuclear disc. Hydrodynamical modelling shows that the apparent discrepancy between the extent of the shocked gas and the radio emission can occur when the brightest regions of the synchrotron-emitting plasma are temporarily halted by dense clumps, while less bright plasma can percolate through the porous ISM and form an energy-driven bubble that expands freely out of the disc plane. Simulations suggest that this bubble is filled with low surface brightness plasma not visible in existing VLBI observations of 4C 31.04 due to insufficient sensitivity. Additional radial flows of jet plasma may percolate to ∼ kpc radii in the circumnuclear disc, driving shocks and accelerating clouds of gas, giving rise to the H2 emission.},

	abstract = {We argue that the magnetic flux threading the black hole (BH), rather than BH spin or Eddington ratio, is the dominant factor in launching powerful jets and thus determining the radio loudness of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Most AGNs are radio quiet because the thin accretion disks that feed them are inefficient in depositing magnetic flux close to the BH. Flux accumulation is more likely to occur during a hot accretion (or thick disk) phase, and we argue that radio-loud quasars and strong emission-line radio galaxies occur only when a massive, cold accretion event follows an episode of hot accretion. Such an event might be triggered by the merger of a giant elliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy. This picture supports the idea that flux accumulation can lead to the formation of a so-called magnetically choked accretion flow. The large observed range in radio loudness reflects not only the magnitude of the flux pressed against the BH, but also the decrease in UV flux from the disk, due to its disruption by the "magnetosphere" associated with the accumulated flux. While the strongest jets result from the secular accumulation of flux, moderate jet activity can also be
triggered by fluctuations in the magnetic flux deposited by turbulent, hot inner regions of otherwise thin accretion disks, or by the
dissipation of turbulent fields in accretion disk coronae. These processes could be responsible for jet production in Seyferts and low-luminosity AGNs, as well as jets associated with X-ray binaries.},

	abstract = {We present full Stokes radio polarization observations of the quasar PKS B2126−158 (z = 3.268) from 1 to 10 GHz using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The source has large fractional circular polarization (CP), mc ≡ {\textbar}V{\textbar}/I, detected at high signiﬁcance across the entire band (from 15 to 90σ per 128 MHz subband). This allows us to construct the most robust CP spectrum of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet to date. We ﬁnd mc ∝ ν+0.60 ± 0.03 from 1.5 to 6.5 GHz, with a peak of mc ∼ 1 per cent before the spectrum turns over somewhere between 6.5 and 8 GHz, above which mc ∝ ν−3.0 ± 0.4. The fractional linear polarization (LP; p) varies from 0.2 to ∼1 per cent across our frequency range and is strongly anticorrelated with the fractional CP, with a best-ﬁtting power law giving mc ∝ p−0.24 ± 0.03. This is the ﬁrst clear relation between the observed LP and CP of an AGN jet, revealing the action of Faraday conversion of LP to CP within the jet. More detailed modelling in conjunction with high spatial resolution observations are required to determine the true driving force behind the conversion (i.e. magnetic twist or internal Faraday rotation). In particular determining whether the observed Faraday rotation is internal or entirely external to the jet is key to this goal. The simplest interpretation of our observations favours some internal Faraday rotation, implying that Faraday rotation-driven conversion of LP to CP is the dominant CP generation mechanism. In this case, a small amount of vector-ordered magnetic ﬁeld along the jet axis is required, along with internal Faraday rotation from the low-energy end of the relativistic electron energy spectrum in an electron–proton-dominated jet.},

These simulations are applicable to the GPS/CSS phase of extragalactic radio sources. The interstellar medium in these simulations consists of a conventional hot (T{\textasciitilde}107 K) component together with a warm (T{\textasciitilde}104 K) turbulently
supported disk whose local density is described by a lognormal density distribution and whose spatial structure is realized from a fractal power law. We model the jet as a light, supersonic nonrelativistic flow with parameters selected to be consistent with a relativistic jet with kinetic power just above the FR1/FR2 break. We identify four generic phases in the evolution of such a jet with the inhomogeneous
interstellar medium: (1) an initial ``flood and channel'' phase, where progress is characterized by high-pressure gas finding changing weak points in the ISM, flowing through channels that form and reform over time; (2) a spherical, energy-driven bubble phase, where the bubble is larger than the disk scale, but the jet remains fully disrupted close to the nucleus; (3) a subsequent, rapid, jet break-out phase where the jet breaks free of the last obstructing dense clouds, becomes collimated once more, and pierces the spherical bubble; and (4) a classical phase, where the jet propagates in a momentum-dominated fashion similar to jets in single-component hot halos, leading to the classical jet-cocoon-bow shock structure. Mass transport in the simulations is investigated, and we propose a model for the morphology and component proper motions in the well-studied compact symmetric object 4C 31.04.},

	abstract = {We study the interactions of a relativistic jet with a dense turbulent gaseous disc of radius ∼2 kpc. We have performed a suite of
simulations with different mean density, jet power, and orientation. Our results show that: (A) The relativistic jet couples strongly with the gas in the inner kpc, creating a cavity and launching outflows. (B) The high pressure bubble inflated by the jet and its back-flow compresses the disc at the outer edges, driving inflows within the disc. (C) Jets inclined towards the disc affect the disc more and launch
sub-relativistic, wide-angled outflows along the minor axis. (D) Shocks driven directly by the jet and the jet-driven energy bubble raise the velocity dispersion throughout the disc by several times its initial value. (E) Compression by the jet-driven shocks can enhance the star formation rate in the disc, especially in a ring-like geometry close to the axis. However, enhanced turbulent dispersion in the disc also leads to quenching of star formation. Whether positive or negative feedback dominates depends on jet power, ISM density, jet orientation with respect to the disc, and the time-scale under consideration.
Qualitatively, our simulations compare favourably with kinematic and morphological signatures of several observed galaxies such as NGC 1052, NGC 3079, 3C 326, and 3C 293.},

We describe the effect of the jet on the evolution of the density of the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). The jet-driven energy bubble affects the gas to distances up to several kiloparsecs from the injection region. The shocks resulting from such interactions create a multiphase ISM and radial outflows. One of the striking result of this work is that low-power jets (Pjet ≲
1043 ergs-1), although less efficient in
accelerating clouds, are trapped in the ISM for a longer time and hence affect the ISM over a larger volume. Jets of higher power drill through with relative ease. Although the relativistic jets launch strong outflows, there is little net mass ejection to very large distances, supporting a galactic fountain scenario for local feedback.},

	abstract = {The nearby cluster Abell194 hosts two luminous, distorted radio galaxies. Both reside within the cluster's core region, being separated in projection by only 100 kpc. It is often suggested that tailed radio galaxies such as these reside in clusters that are under formation and are accreting new material from their outskirts. In this paper, we study the intriguing appearance of Abell 194, and test whether the cluster and radio source dynamics are consistent with the cluster formation/merger model. We analyse data from the XMM-Newton satellite and previously unpublished observations with the Very Large Array as well as present new data from the Giant Metre-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT).

The shape of the jets, and the lack of significant stripping of the galaxies' interstellar media, indicates that the radio galaxies are not moving at the large velocities they would have had if they were falling into the cluster from its outskirts; galaxy velocities of
{\textless}=300kms-1 are adequate instead. A plausible scenario that could explain the observations is that the dynamics of the cluster centre are relatively quiescent, with the dominant system of massive galaxies being bound and orbiting the cluster centre of mass. For plausible jet/plume speeds and densities and the galaxy dynamics implied by this picture of the cluster, we show that the observed jet structures can be explained without invoking a major cluster merger event.},

galaxies, but the empirical evidence for a physical correlation between
star formation rate (SFR) and the properties of active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) remain highly controversial. We take advantage of a recently
developed SFR estimator based on the [O II] λ3727 and [O III]
λ5007 emission lines to investigate the SFRs of the host galaxies
of more than 5800 type-1 and 7600 type-2 AGNs with z {\textless} 0.35. After
matching in luminosity and redshift, we find that type-1 and type-2 AGNs
have a similar distribution of internal reddening, which is significant
and corresponds to ∼109 M⊙ of cold
molecular gas. In spite of their comparable gas content, type-2 AGNs,
independent of stellar mass, Eddington ratio, redshift or molecular gas
mass, exhibit intrinsically stronger star formation activity than type-1
AGNs, in apparent disagreement with the conventional AGN unified model.
We observe a tight, linear relation between AGN luminosity (accretion
rate) and SFR, one that becomes more significant toward smaller physical
scales, suggesting that the link between the AGN and star formation
occurs in the central kpc-scale region. This, along with a correlation
between SFR and Eddington ratio in the regime of super-Eddington
accretion, can be interpreted as evidence that star formation is
impacted by positive feedback from the AGN.},

The prediction is that if suﬃcient fuel exists, FR0 radio galaxies will evolve into full- ﬂedged FRI radio galaxies and the observational dearth of FRI radio galaxies compared to FR0s at low redshift tells us about the supply of gas in the low redshift FR0s. Given the model prescription, this 5 to 1 FR0 to FRI ratio implies that at low redshift the FRII quasar class of active galaxies struggles to fuel its black hole beyond 1.3 times its original mass. In addition to this, we illustrate model prescriptions for the black hole mass, black hole spin, redshift and environment distribution for FR0 radio galaxies by ﬁtting them within a paradigm that views them as a continuous class of active galaxies that are sandwiched between FRII quasars and FRI radio galaxies.},

	abstract = {A key question in the formation of the relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is the collimation process of their energetic plasma flow launched from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Recent observations of nearby low-luminosity radio galaxies exhibit a clear picture of parabolic collimation inside the Bondi accretion radius. On the other hand, little is known of the observational properties of jet collimation in more luminous quasars, where the accretion flow may be significantly different due to much higher accretion rates. In this paper, we present preliminary results of multi-frequency observations of the archetypal quasar 3C 273 with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.4, 15, and 43 GHz, and Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) at 1.6 GHz. The observations provide a detailed view of the transverse structure resolved on a broad range of spatial scales from sub-parsec to kilo parsecs, allowing us to profile the jet width as a function of the distance from the core for the first time in jets of bright quasars. We discovered a transition from a parabolic stream to a conical stream, which has been seen in much lower-luminosity radio galaxies. The similarity in the profile to the much lower-powered radio galaxy M87 suggests the universality of jet collimation among AGNs with different accretion rates.},

We find a fundamental difference in between radiative-mode AGN (i.e., high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) and radio-loud QSOs) and jet-mode AGN (i.e., low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs)). While LERGs can achieve a wide range of (up to ∼30\%), the HERGs and radio-loud QSOs are limited to . A difference in is also seen when the sample is divided at 0.5\% of the total Eddington-scaled accretion rate, where the weakly accreting sources can attain higher values of . We do not find any clear evidence that this is driven by intrinsic magnetic field differences of the different radio morphological classes. Instead, we attribute the differences in to the local environments of the radio sources, in terms of both the ambient gas density and the magnetoionic properties of this gas. Thus, not only are different large-scale gaseous environments potentially responsible for the different accretion states of HERGs and LERGs, we argue that the large-scale magnetized environments may also be important for the formation of powerful AGN jets.

	title = {Source classification in deep radio surveys using machine learning techniques},
	url = {https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/31250},
	abstract = {Until now radio galaxies have primarily been classified using the human neural system. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will, however, produce a very large amount of science data, extending into the multiple-petabyte range. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop new, automated techniques to maximally exploit the SKA data. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are currently being used in several fields of Astrophysics and in this thesis we comprehensively explore ML as a way to distinguish point and extended sources (P-E) and to classify radio galaxies as belonging to Fanaroff-Riley class I or II (FRI-FRII). Our first step was to classify radio sources based on their morphology using filtering methods. We used images from the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) and compared the following techniques: (i) the LULU operators and the Discrete Pulse Transform (DPT) algorithms with a low and high pass filtering. The LULU and DPT algorithms have only been successful in classifying extended sources and are computationally expensive. (ii) we then explored other techniques to extract the sources by applying a high pass filter to the radio images. Using Otsu thresholding and Gaussian filtering methods, we have been able to extract not only extended sources but also made gains in computational time. Our next approach has been to classify P-E and FRI-FRII sources using various ML algorithms. These included the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) which require specific features of the radio images as inputs. We implemented shapelet analysis to decompose the radio images into their corresponding shapelet coefficients which are then fed into the ML algorithms. For P-E discrimination, a neural network was the most effective algorithm, with an accuracy of 89\% and area under curve (AUC) value of 93\%. For FRI-FRII sources, the RF algorithm proved to be the best with an accuracy of 75\% and AUC value of 74\%. The final stage of this thesis has been to apply deep learning to FRI-FRII source classification in the form of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For the first time in radio astronomy we have added a Generative Adversarial Neural (GAN) network to generate realistic looking data to supplement the real data during training. The result from the CNN+GAN algorithm has proved to be better than both the RF algorithm and the CNN alone with standard data augmentation (flipping and rotation), yielding an accuracy of 84\% and AUC value of 85\%, showing that combining GANs with convolutional networks for radio astronomy is likely to add significant value in the era of the SKA.},

We train MCRGNet and implement the classification task by a three-step strategy, i.e., pre-training, fine-tuning, and classification, which combines both unsupervised and supervised learnings. A four-layer dichotomous tree is designed to classify the radio AGNs, which leads to a significantly better performance than the direct six-type classification. On the LRG sample, our MCRGNet achieves a total precision of ∼93\% and an averaged sensitivity of ∼87\%, which are better than those obtained in previous works. On the unLRG sample, whose labels have been human-inspected, the neural network achieves a total precision of ∼80\%. Also, using Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 to calculate the r-band absolute magnitude (M opt) and using the flux densities to calculate the radio luminosity (L radio), we find that the distributions of the unLRG sources on the L radio–M opt plane do not show an apparent redshift evolution and could confirm with a sufficiently large sample that there could not exist an abrupt separation between FRIs and FRIIs as reported in some previous works.},

We carry out a comparison between several common machine learning methods for galaxy classification (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), K-nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Neural Networks) by using Dark Energy Survey (DES) data combined with visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo 1 project (GZ1). Our goal is to determine the optimal machine learning methods when using imaging data for galaxy classification. We show that CNN is the most successful method of these ten methods in our study. Using a sample of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2,800 galaxies with visual classification from GZ1, we reach an accuracy of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.99 for the morphological classification of Ellipticals and Spirals. The further investigation of the galaxies that have a different ML and visual classification but with high predicted probabilities in our CNN usually reveals an the incorrect classification provided by GZ1. We further find the galaxies having a low probability of being either spirals or ellipticals are visually Lenticulars (S0), demonstrating that supervised learning is able to rediscover that this class of galaxy is distinct from both Es and Spirals. We confirm that \${\textbackslash}sim\$2.5{\textbackslash}\% galaxies are misclassified by GZ1 in our study. After correcting these galaxies' labels, we improve our CNN performance to an average accuracy of over 0.99 (accuracy of 0.994 is our best result).},

We show that the neural network behaves in our problem as a Bayesian classifier, i.e. it assigns the a posteriori probability for each of the five classes considered. The network highest probability choice agrees with the catalogue classification for 64 percent of the galaxies.

input parameters and one output, evaluated to 1 for quasars and 0 for
non-quasars during the training, were used, with architectures 7: 1 and
7: 2: 1. Both models were trained on samples of {\textasciitilde}800 sources and yielded
similar performance on independent test samples, with reliability as
large as 87 per cent at 80 per cent completeness (or 90 to 80 per cent
for completeness from 70 to 90 per cent). For comparison, the quasar
fraction from the original candidate list was 56 per cent. The accuracy
is similar to that found by White et al. using supervised learning with
oblique decision trees and training samples of similar size. In view of
the large degree of overlapping between quasars and non-quasars in the
parameter space, this performance probably approaches the maximum value
achievable with this data base. Predictions of the probabilities for the
98 candidates without spectroscopic classification in White et al. are
presented and compared with the results from their work. The values
obtained for the two ANN models and the decision trees are found to be

that these star/galaxy classifications are expected to be reliable for
approximately 22 million objects with r{\textless}{\textasciitilde}20. The general machine
learning environment Data-to-Knowledge and supercomputing resources
enabled extensive investigation of the decision tree parameter space.
This work presents the first public release of objects classified in
this way for an entire SDSS data release. The objects are classified as
either galaxy, star, or nsng (neither star nor galaxy), with an
associated probability for each class. To demonstrate how to effectively
make use of these classifications, we perform several important tests.
First, we detail selection criteria within the probability space defined
by the three classes to extract samples of stars and galaxies to a given
completeness and efficiency. Second, we investigate the efficacy of the
classifications and the effect of extrapolating from the spectroscopic
regime by performing blind tests on objects in the SDSS, 2dFGRS, and 2QZ
surveys. Given the photometric limits of our spectroscopic training
data, we effectively begin to extrapolate past our star-galaxy training
set at r{\textasciitilde}18. By comparing the number counts of our training sample with
the classified sources, however, we find that our efficiencies appear to
remain robust to r{\textasciitilde}20. As a result, we expect our classifications to be
accurate for 900,000 galaxies and 6.7 million stars and remain robust

	abstract = {We present morphological classifications obtained using machine learning for objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR6 that have been
classified by Galaxy Zoo into three classes, namely early types, spirals and point sources/artefacts. An artificial neural network is trained on a subset of objects classified by the human eye, and we test whether the machine-learning algorithm can reproduce the human classifications for the rest of the sample. We find that the success of the neural network in matching the human classifications depends crucially on the set of input parameters chosen for the machine-learning algorithm. The colours and parameters associated with profile fitting are reasonable in separating the objects into three classes. However, these results are considerably improved when adding adaptive shape parameters as well as concentration and texture. The adaptive moments, concentration and texture parameters alone cannot distinguish between early type galaxies and the point sources/artefacts. Using a set of 12 parameters, the neural network is able to reproduce the human classifications to better than 90 per cent for all three morphological classes. We find that using a training set that is incomplete in magnitude does not degrade our results given our particular choice of the input parameters to the network. We conclude that it is promising to use machine-learning algorithms to perform morphological classification for the next
generation of wide-field imaging surveys and that the Galaxy Zoo catalogue provides an invaluable training set for such purposes.

	abstract = {A small number of double-lobed radio galaxies (17 from our own census of the literature) show an additional pair of low surface brightness ‘‘wings,’’ thus forming an overall X-shaped appearance. The origin of the wings in these radio sources is unclear. They may be the result of backﬂowing plasma from the currently active radio lobes into an asymmetric medium surrounding the active nucleus, which would make these ideal systems in which to study thermal/ nonthermal plasma interactions in extragalactic radio sources. Another possibility is that the wings are the aging radio lobes left over after a (rapid) realignment of the central supermassive black holeYaccretion disk system due perhaps to a merger. Generally, these models are not well tested; with the small number of known examples, previous works have focused on detailed case studies of selected sources with little attempt at a systematic study of a large sample. Using the VLA FIRST survey database, we are compiling a large sample of winged and X-shaped radio sources for such studies. As a ﬁrst step toward this goal, an initial sample of 100 new candidate objects of this type are presented in this paper. The search process is described, and optical identiﬁcations from available literature data and basic radio data are presented. From the limited-resolution FIRST images (\$500), we can already conﬁdently classify a sufﬁcient number of these objects as having the characteristic wing lengths of {\textgreater}80\% of the active lobes to more than double the number of known X-shaped radio sources. We have also included as candidates radio sources with shorter wings ({\textless}80\% wing-to-lobe length ratios), or simply ‘‘winged’’ sources, as it is probable that projection effects are important. Finally, among the candidates are four quasars (z ¼ 0:37Y0:84), and several have morphologies suggestive of Fanaroff-Riley type I (lowpower) radio galaxies. While follow-up observations are necessary to conﬁrm these identiﬁcations, this stresses the importance of source orientation and imaging limitations in ﬁnding these enigmatic objects.},

The last six decades of radio astronomy research has led to the detection of thousands of radio galaxies. However, only ∼300 of them can be classified as GRGs. The reasons behind their large size and rarity are unknown. We carried out a systematic search for these radio giants and found a large sample of GRGs. In this paper, we report the discovery of 25 GRGs from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Large Array Sky Survey, in the red-shift range z ∼ 0.07 to 0.67. Their physical sizes range from ∼0.8 Mpc to ∼4 Mpc. Eight of
these GRGs have sizes ≥2 Mpc, which is a rarity. Here, for the first time, we investigate the mid-infrared (IR) properties of the optical hosts of the GRGs and classify them securely into various active galactic nuclei types using the WISE mid-IR colours. Using radio and IR data, four of the hosts of the GRGs were observed to be radio-loud quasars that extend up to 2 Mpc in radio size. These GRGs missed detection in earlier searches possibly because of their highly diffuse nature, low surface brightness and lack of optical data. The new GRGs are a significant addition to the existing sample. They will contribute to a better understanding of the physical properties of radio giants.},

            Discovering pulsars is a significant and meaningful research topic in the field of radio astronomy. With the advent of astronomical instruments, the volume and rate of data acquisition have grown exponentially. This development necessitates a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can mine large astronomical data sets. Automatic pulsar candidate identification (APCI) can be considered as a task determining potential candidates for further investigation and eliminating the noise of radio-frequency interference and other non-pulsar signals. As reported in the existing literature, AI techniques, especially convolutional neural network (CNN)-based techniques, have been adopted for APCI. However, it is challenging to enhance the performance of CNN-based pulsar identification because only an extremely limited number of real pulsar samples exist, which results in a crucial class imbalance problem. To address these problems, we propose a framework that combines a deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN) with a support vector machine (SVM). The DCGAN is used as a sample generation and feature learning model, and the SVM is adopted as the classifier for predicting the label of a candidate at the inference stage. The proposed framework is a novel technique, which not only can solve the class imbalance problem but also can learn the discriminative feature representations of pulsar candidates instead of computing hand-crafted features in the pre-processing steps. The proposed method can enhance the accuracy of the APCI, and the computer experiments performed on two pulsar data sets verified the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

First Images of Radio Sky at Twenty Centimetre (FIRST) and the National

created the largest handmade catalogue of visually classified radio

32,616 galaxies with a FIRST core within 3 arcsec of the optical

with the signal-to-noise ratio \${\textgreater}\$10 and spectroscopic redshifts up

visual examination of the FIRST and the NVSS contour maps overlaid on a
DSS image, while an optical morphology classification was based on the
120 arcsec snapshot images from SDSS DR 7. The majority of radio
galaxies in ROGUE I, i.e. \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 93\%, are unresolved (compact or
elongated), while the rest of them exhibit extended morphologies, such
as Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I, II, and hybrid, wide-angle tail,
narrow-angle tail, head-tail sources, and sources with intermittent or
reoriented jet activity, i.e. double-double, X-shaped, and Z-shaped.
Most of FR IIs have low radio luminosities, comparable to the
luminosities of FR Is. Moreover, due to visual check of all radio maps
and optical images, we were able to discover or reclassify a number of
radio objects as giant, double-double, X-shaped, and Z-shaped radio
galaxies. The presented sample can serve as a database for training
automatic methods of identification and classification of optical and

Whether such division is a misleading effect from a highly heterogeneous single population of objects, or real has yet to be answered. Such dichotomy has been evidenced by observations of the flux ratio between the optical and radio emissions (usually B band and 5 GHz). Evidence of two populations in quasars and samples of a wide diversity of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been accumulated over the years. Other quantities beyond radio loudness also seem to show the signature of the existence of two different populations of AGNs. To verify the existence of a dichotomy through different parameters, we employed a soft clustering scheme, based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), to classify these objects simultaneously using the following parameters: black hole mass, colour, and R loudness index, as well as the usual radio and B-band luminosity. To investigate whether different kinds of AGNs manifest any population dichotomy, we applied GMM to four independent catalogues composed of both optical and radio information. Our results indicate the persistence of a dichotomy in all data sets, although the discriminating power differs for different choices of parameters. Although the radio loudness parameter alone does not seem to be enough to display the dichotomy, the evidence of two populations of AGNs could persist even if we consider other parameters. Our research suggests that the dichotomy is not a misleading effect but real.},

	abstract = {We present the first results of a project called SAGAN, which is 
dedicated solely to the studies of relatively rare megaparsec-scale
radio galaxies in the Universe, called giant radio galaxies (GRGs). We
have identified 162 new GRGs primarily from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey with
sizes ranging from ∼0.71 Mpc to ∼2.82 Mpc in the redshift range
of ∼0.03-0.95, of which 23 are hosted by quasars (giant radio
quasars). As part of the project SAGAN, we have created a database of
all known GRGs, the GRG catalogue, from the literature (including our
new sample); it includes 820 sources. For the first time, we present the
multi-wavelength properties of the largest sample of GRGs. This provides
new insights into their nature. Our results establish that the
distributions of the radio spectral index and the black hole mass of
GRGs do not differ from the corresponding distributions of normal-sized
radio galaxies (RGs). However, GRGs have a lower Eddington ratio than
RGs. Using the mid-infrared data, we classified GRGs in terms of their
accretion mode: either a high-power radiatively efficient
high-excitation state, or a radiatively inefficient low-excitation
state. This enabled us to compare key physical properties of their
active galactic nuclei, such as the black hole mass, spin, Eddington
ratio, jet kinetic power, total radio power, magnetic field, and size.
We find that GRGs in high-excitation state statistically have larger
sizes, stronger radio power, jet kinetic power, and higher Eddington
ratio than those in low-excitation state. Our analysis reveals a strong
correlation between the black hole Eddington ratio and the scaled jet
kinetic power, which suggests a disc-jet coupling. Our environmental
study reveals that ∼10\% of all GRGs may reside at the centres of
galaxy clusters, in a denser galactic environment, while the majority
appears to reside in a sparse environment. The probability of finding
the brightest cluster galaxy as a GRG is quite low and even lower for
high-mass clusters. We present new results for GRGs that range from
black hole mass to large-scale environment properties. We discuss their
formation and growth scenarios, highlighting the key physical factors
that cause them to reach their gigantic size.

We demonstrate quantitatively how the selection of normalisation and aggregation methods used in attention-gating can aﬀect the output of individual models, and show that the resulting attention maps can be used to interpret the classiﬁcation choices made by the model. We observe that the salient regions identiﬁed by the our model align well with the regions an expert human classiﬁer would attend to make equivalent classiﬁcations. We show that while the selection of normalisation and aggregation may only minimally aﬀect the performance of individual models, it can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the interpretability of the respective attention maps and by selecting a model which aligns well with how astronomers classify radio sources by eye, a user can employ the model in a more eﬀective manner.},

In this paper, we explore the task of radio galaxy classification based on morphology using deep learning methods with a focus on using a small scale dataset ({\textasciitilde} 2000 samples). We apply few-shot learning techniques based on Siamese Networks and transfer learning techniques using a pre-trained DenseNet model with advanced techniques like cyclical learning rate,
discriminative learning to train the model rapidly. We achieve a classification accuracy of over 92\% using our best performing model with the biggest source of confusion being between Bent and FRII type galaxies. Our results show that focusing on a small but curated dataset along with the use of best practices to train the neural network can lead to good results. Automated classification techniques will be crucial for upcoming surveys with next generation radio telescopes which are expected to detect thousands of new radio galaxies in the future.},

Aims: Our aim is to demonstrate that saliency maps provide the means to understand predictions from machine learning algorithms and can be implemented in pipelines used to search for transient events. Methods: We implemented a new deep learning methodology to predict whether any segment of the data contains a transient event. The algorithm was trained using real and simulated data sets. We demonstrate that the algorithm is able to identify such events. The output results are visually analysed via the use of saliency maps. Results: We find that saliency maps can produce an enhanced image of any transient feature without the need for de-dispersion or removal of radio frequency interference. The maps can be used to understand which features in the image were used in making the machine learning decision and to visualise the transient event. Even though the algorithm reported here was developed to demonstrate saliency-map analysis, we have detected a single burst event, in archival data, with dispersion measure of 41 cm-3 pc that is not associated with any currently known pulsar.},

It aims to search for the most promising pulsar candidates from an all-sky survey, such as the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU), Green Bank Northern Celestial Cap (GBNCC), Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope, etc. Recently, machine learning (ML) has become a hot topic in investigations of pulsar candidate sifting. However, one typical challenge in ML for pulsar candidate sifting comes from the learning difficulty arising from the high class imbalance between the observed numbers of pulsars and non-pulsars. Therefore, this work proposes a novel framework for candidate sifting, named Multi-input Convolutional Neural Networks (MICNN). MICNN is an architecture of deep learning with four diagnostic plots of a pulsar candidate as its inputs. To train our MICNN on a highly class-imbalanced data set, a novel image augmentation technique is proposed, as well as a three-stage training strategy. Experiments on observations from HTRU and GBNCC show the effectiveness and robustness of these proposed techniques. In the experiments on HTRU, our MICNN model achieves a recall rate of 0.962 and a precision rate of 0.967 even in a highly class-imbalanced test data set.},

exploitation of radio surveys. Source-finding usually involves
identifying the parts of an image belonging to an astronomical source,
against some estimated background. This can be problematic in the radio
regime, owing to the presence of correlated noise, which can interfere
with the signal from the source. In the current work, we present
ConvoSource, a novel method based on a deep learning technique, to
identify the positions of radio sources, and compare the results to a
Gaussian-fitting method. Since the deep learning approach allows the
generation of more training images, it should perform well in the
source-finding task. We test the source-finding methods on artificial
data created for the data challenge of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).
We investigate sources that are divided into three classes: star forming
galaxies (SFGs) and two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The
artificial data are given at two different frequencies (560 MHz and 1400
MHz), three total integration times (8 h, 100 h, 1000 h), and three
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 1, 2, and 5. At lower SNRs, ConvoSource
tends to outperform a Gaussian-fitting approach in the recovery of SFGs
and all sources, although at the lowest SNR of one, the better
performance is likely due to chance matches. The Gaussian-fitting method
performs better in the recovery of the AGN-type sources at lower SNRs.
At a higher SNR, ConvoSource performs better on average in the recovery
of AGN sources, whereas the Gaussian-fitting method performs better in
the recovery of SFGs and all sources. ConvoSource usually performs
better at shorter total integration times and detects more true
positives and misses fewer sources compared to the Gaussian-fitting
method; however, it detects more false positives.},

The results of this study demonstrate that the new model can sort {\textgreater}96\% of real
pulsars to belong the top 1\% of all candidates and classify {\textgreater}1.6 million candidates per day using a dual-GPU and 24-core computer. This increased speed and efficiency can help to facilitate real-time or quasi-real-time processing of the pulsar-search data stream obtained from CRAFTS.

Machine learning is a promising solution, allowing the development of algorithms tailored to specific telescope arrays and science cases. We present DEEPSOURCE - a deep learning solution - that uses convolutional neural networks to achieve these goals. DEEPSOURCE enhances the SNR of the sources in the original map and then uses dynamic blob detection to detect sources. Trained and tested on two sets of 500 simulated 1° × 1° MeerKAT images
with a total of 300 000 sources, DEEPSOURCE is essentially perfect in both purity and completeness down to SNR = 4 and outperforms PYBDSF in all metrics. For uniformly weighted images, it achieves a Purity × Completeness (PC) score at SNR = 3 of 0.73, compared to 0.31 for the best PYBDSF model. For natural weighting, we find a smaller improvement of \{∼ \} 40\{\{ per cent\}\} in the PC score at SNR = 3. If instead we ask where either of the purity or completeness first drops to 90\{\{ per cent\}\}, we find that DEEPSOURCE reaches this value at SNR = 3.6 compared to the 4.3 of PYBDSF (natural weighting). A key advantage of DEEPSOURCE is that it can learn to optimally trade off purity and completeness for any science case under consideration.

astronomical images.},

The abundance of false positives presents an intractable problem if candidates are to be inspected by eye, making it a good application for artificial intelligence (AI). We apply deep learning to single-pulse classification and develop a hierarchical framework for ranking events by their probability of being astrophysical transients. We construct a treelike deep neural network that takes multiple or individual data products as input (e.g., dynamic spectra and multibeam information) and trains on them simultaneously. We have built training and test sets using false-positive triggers from real
telescopes, simulated FRBs, and pulsar single pulses. Training the network was independently done for both the CHIME Pathfinder and Apertif. High accuracy and recall can be achieved with a labeled training set of a few thousand events. Even with high triggering rates, classification can be done very quickly on graphical processing units, which is essential for selective voltage dumps or real-time VOEvents. We investigate whether dedispersion back ends could be replaced by a real-time DNN classifier. It is shown that a single forward propagation through a moderate convolutional network could be faster than
brute-force dedispersion, but the low signal-to-noise per pixel makes such a classifier suboptimal for this problem. Real-time automated classification will prove useful for bright, unexpected signals, both now and when searchable parameter spaces outgrow our ability to manually inspect data, such as for the SKA and ngVLA.},

	abstract = {Discovering pulsars is a significant and meaningful research topic in the field of radio astronomy. With the advent of astronomical
instruments such as he Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in China, data volumes and data rates are exponentially growing. This fact necessitates a focus on artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies that can perform the automatic pulsar candidate
identification to mine large astronomical data sets. Automatic pulsar candidate identification can be considered as a task of determining potential candidates for further investigation and eliminating noises of radio frequency interferences or other non-pulsar signals. It is very hard to raise the performance of DCNN-based pulsar identification because the limited training samples restrict network structure to be designed deep enough for learning good features as well as the crucial class imbalance problem due to very limited number of real pulsar samples. To address these problems, we proposed a framework which combines deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN) with support vector machine (SVM) to deal with imbalance class problem and to improve pulsar identification accuracy. DCGAN is used as sample
generation and feature learning model, and SVM is adopted as the classifier for predicting candidate's labels in the inference stage. The proposed framework is a novel technique which not only can solve imbalance class problem but also can learn discriminative feature representations of pulsar candidates instead of computing hand-crafted features in preprocessing steps too, which makes it more accurate for automatic pulsar candidate selection. Experiments on two pulsar datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.},

Convolutional neural networks are the deep learning technique that has
proven to be the most successful in classifying image data. Capsule
networks are a more recently developed technique that use capsules
comprised of groups of neurons that describe properties of an image
including the relative spatial locations of features. This work explores
the performance of different capsule network architectures against
simpler convolutional neural network architectures, in reproducing the
classifications into the classes of unresolved, FRI, and FRII
morphologies. We utilize images from a LOFAR survey which is the
deepest, wide-area radio survey to date, revealing more complex
radio-source structures compared to previous surveys, presenting further
challenges for machine learning algorithms. The four- and eight-layer
convolutional networks attain an average precision of 93.3 per cent and
94.3 per cent, respectively, compared to 89.7 per cent obtained with the
capsule network, when training on original and augmented images.
Implementing transfer learning achieves a precision of 94.4 per cent,
which is within the confidence interval of the eight-layer convolutional
network. The convolutional networks always outperform any variation of
the capsule network, as they prove to be more robust to the presence of
noise in images. The use of pooling appears to allow more freedom for
the intra-class variability of radio galaxy morphologies, as well as
reducing the impact of noise.},

Future work will improve CLARAN's relatively lower success rates in dealing with multisource fields and will enable CLARAN to identify sources on much larger fields without loss in classification accuracy.},

classification of images. The challenge, in the case of radio
interferometric data, is the presence of noise and the lack of a sufficiently large number of labelled images for the training. We have specifically addressed these problems and the resulting software, COSMODEEP, proved to be an accurate, efficient and effective solution for detecting very faint sources in the simulated radio images.

the science goals of next generation radio surveys. Radio galaxies have
been traditionally classified as Fanaroff-Riley (FR) I and II, although
some exhibit more complex `bent' morphologies arising from environmental
factors or intrinsic properties. In this work, we present the FIRST

Extended radio sources. We developed the FIRST Classifier based on a
trained deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automate the
morphological classification of compact and extended radio sources
observed in the FIRST radio survey. Our model achieved an overall

based autoencoder (DNNAE) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The
encoder and decoder subnets in the DNNAE are symmetric aside a
fully-connected layer namely code layer hosting the extracted feature
vectors. By randomly generating the feature vectors later with a
three-component Gaussian Mixture models, new FRI or FRII radio galaxy
morphologies are simulated. Experiments were demonstrated on real radio
galaxy images, where we discussed the length of feature vectors,
selection of lost functions, and made comparisons on batch normalization
and dropout techniques for training the network. The results suggest a
high efficiency and performance of our morphology generation framework.

	abstract = {Cross-identifying complex radio sources with optical or infrared 
counterparts in surveys such as the Australia Telescope Large Area
Survey (ATLAS) has traditionally been performed by a visual inspection
of individual sources. However, with new surveys from the Australian
Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder detecting many tens of million of
radio sources such an approach is no longer feasible. The Likelihood
Ratio (LR) allows the use of additional data about survey objects to be
cross matched rather than just position and proximity, such as flux,
probability distribution and catalogue surface density. This thesis
presents a new software algorithm (LRPY - Likelihood Ratio in PYthon) to
automate the process of cross-identifying radio sources with catalogues
at other wavelengths using the LR. I demonstrate LRPY by applying it to
the ATLAS Data Release 3 and a Spitzer-based multi-wavelength catalogue,
identifying 3,848 cross matched sources using my LR-based selection
criteria. I found that LRPY could be extended to identify radio sources
with multiple infrared counterparts many of which I identify as
interacting galaxy pairs. In addition I also investigated if LRPY could
be used to select radio sources with more complex morphology, such as
double lobe radio sources. This extension to the algorithm is shown to
work well in identifying the host of many double lobe radio sources. A
subset of 1987 cross matched sources in this thesis have flux density
values for all four bands in the Spitzer/IRAC instrument, which allowed
me to use various criteria to distinguish between active galactic nuclei
(AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFG). I found that 936 radio sources
(≈47\%) meet both of the Lacy and Stern AGN selection criteria. Of the
matched sources, 295 have spectroscopic redshifts and we examine the
radio to infrared flux ratio vs redshift, proposing an AGN selection
criterion below the Elvis radio-loud (RL) AGN limit for this dataset.
Taking the union of all three AGN selection criteria I have identified
956 cross matched sources as AGN (≈48\%). From this dataset, we find a
decreasing fraction of AGN with lower radio flux densities consistent
with other results in the literature. I found there is a strong power
law correlation demonstrated using the complete Fusion dataset seen in
the AGN arm of the MIR [3.6]-[5.8] vs [4.5]-[8.0] plot for the LACY AGN
selection wedge, but there was no such strong correlation for the Stern
AGN wedge of the MIR [5.8]-[8.0] vs [3.6]-[4.5] colour-colour plot. Due
to this I have analysed the cross matched sources in this thesis for a
power law relationship, it was apparent that for the MIR [3.6]-[5.8] vs
[4.5]-[8.0] colour-colour plots used for Lacy AGN selection the
correlation between the AGN candidate infrared flux ratios to the
power-law locus is very strong in the AGN arm. The Stern MIR
colour-colour criteria [5.8]-[8.0] vs [3.6]-[4.5] shows no strong
correlation for the AGN candidate infrared flux ratios to the power-law
locus for the cross matched sources. I have also looked at the
relationship between the MIR 8.0μm to radio 1.4GHz relationship,
there is a clear distinction between AGN and SFG's. I have also looked
at the relationship between the Radio L1.4 GHz and MIR
luminosities L3.6 μm and L4.5μm, as prior
work had provided existence of a correlation. What was found is that the
higher redshift sources (z{\textgreater}0.3) lie within the top right quadrant of
the plots, when the Stern and Lacy AGN are identified we see the
majority of these AGN also lie within this same quadrant. Looking at the
AGN selected sources we see a slope close to unity at both MIR
wavelengths, for 3.6μm the slope is m = 1.004 ± 0.155 and at
4.5μm it was found to be m = 0.980 ± 0.153. I conclude the
thesis by summarizing the work and discussing future work to be
undertaken as a result of the research.},

Decision-tree pattern-recognition software was applied to training-set source pairs developed from known NVSS large-angular-size radio galaxies. The full training set consisted of 51,195 source pairs, 48 of which were known GRSs for which each lobe was primarily
represented by a single catalog component. The source pairs had a maximum separation of 20{\textbackslash}prime and a minimum component area of 1.87 square arcmin at the 1.4 mJy level. The importance of comparing the resulting probability distributions of the training and application sets for cases of unknown class ratio is demonstrated. The probability of correctly ranking a randomly selected (GRS, non-GRS) pair from the best of the tested classifiers was determined to be 97.8 ± 1.5\%. The best classifiers were applied to the over 870,000 candidate pairs from the entire catalog. Images of higher-ranked sources were visually screened, and a table of over 1600 candidates, including morphological annotation, is presented. These systems include doubles and triples, wide-angle tail and narrow-angle tail, S- or Z-shaped systems, and core-jets and resolved cores. While some resolved-lobe systems are recovered with this technique, generally it is expected that such systems would require a different approach.},

equivalently black hole mass). All these features agree with those of outflows observed in galaxies such as Mrk231.

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass  and the velocity dispersion σ of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from  in brightest cluster ellipticals to  in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105−106M⊙ are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any  correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution. The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with  suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between  and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in  correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

The search strategy, covering a total footprint area of ∼ 2000 deg2 with a cadence of ≤ 5 days, is optimised for discovery and follow-up of low-redshift type Ia supernovae to constrain cosmic expansion and peculiar velocities. We describe the search operations and infrastructure, including a parallelised software pipeline to discover variable objects in difference imaging; simulations of the performance of the survey over its lifetime; public access to discovered transients; and some ﬁrst results from the Science Veriﬁcation data.},

distance-independent observable, and the absolute magnitude (or
diameter). Such a relation is first sought in nearby calibration galaxies of the Local Group, the M 81 group, and the M 101 group, with well-determined distances, accurately known photometric properties, and accurately known global hydrogen profile width. On the basis of these calibration magnitude-global profile width and diameter-global profile width relationships, distances were derived for the Virgo cluster and the Ursa Major cluster. The distance moduli obtained are 30.6 m for the Virgo cluster and 30.5 m for the Ursa Major cluster. The result for the Virgo cluster suggests a Hubble constant of 80 km per sec per Mpc.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy.

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5\% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7\%.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

EMU is expected to detect 70 million radio sources, including normal star-forming galaxies out to z=0.3, starburst galaxies and radio-quiet AGN out to z=1, radio-loud AGN across the cosmic time back to the epoch of reionisation, and to map the Cosmic Web.
Furthermore, cosmological studies are being undertaken with the survey (large-scale structure, cosmological parameters). And, with the
privileged location in the Southern hemisphere, EMU is surveying radio stars and mapping continuum radio emission of the Galactic Plane and Centre. Given the anticipated vast amount of data, EMU is also preparing for the unexpected discoveries, and is developing automated methods to mine the radio survey data through machine learning and citizen science. The EMU Pilot Survey was observed in 2019, reaching angular resolution of approximately 12 arcsec and noise levels of 20-25 microJy/bm at 943 MHz, over a 270 sq.deg region within the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint. Its analysis is currently undergoing. Here, I present the survey parameters, products and results already being delivered with the EMU early science and pilot survey data.},

low-frequency radio continuum survey of the Northern sky at an
unparalleled resolution and sensitivity. In order to fully exploit this
huge dataset and those produced by the Square Kilometre Array in the
next decade, automated methods in machine learning and data-mining will
be increasingly essential both for morphological classifications and for
identifying optical counterparts to the radio sources. Using
self-organising maps (SOMs), a form of unsupervised machine learning, we
created a dimensionality reduction of the radio morphologies for the
\${\textbackslash}sim\$25k extended radio continuum sources in the LoTSS first data
release, which is only \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 percent of the final LoTSS survey. We
made use of {\textbackslash}textsc\{PINK\}, a code which extends the SOM algorithm with
rotation and flipping invariance, increasing its suitability and
effectiveness for training on astronomical sources. After training, the
SOMs can be used for a wide range of science exploitation and we present
an illustration of their potential by finding an arbitrary number of
morphologically rare sources in our training data (424 square degrees)
and subsequently in an area of the sky (\${\textbackslash}sim\$5300 square degrees)
outside the training data. Objects found in this way span a wide range
of morphological and physical categories: extended jets of radio active
galactic nuclei, diffuse cluster haloes and relics, and nearby spiral
galaxies. Finally, to enable accessible, interactive, and intuitive data
exploration, we showcase the LOFAR-PyBDSF Visualisation Tool, which
allows users to explore the LoTSS dataset through the trained SOMs.},

interferometer consisting of 36 ×12 -m dishes equipped with
Phased-Array Feeds (PAFs), located in an extremely radio-quiet zone in Western Australia. WALLABY aims to survey three-quarters of the sky (-90∘{\textless}δ {\textless}+30∘) to a redshift
of z ≲0.26 , and generate spectral line image cubes at ∼30
arcsec resolution and ∼1.6 mJy beam-1 per 4 km
s-1 channel sensitivity. ASKAP's instantaneous field of view at 1.4 GHz, delivered by the PAF's 36 beams, is about 30 sq deg. At an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of five, WALLABY is expected to detect around half a million galaxies with a mean redshift of z
∼0.05 (∼200 Mpc). The scientific goals of WALLABY include:
(a) a census of gas-rich galaxies in the vicinity of the Local Group; (b) a study of the HI properties of galaxies, groups and clusters, in particular the influence of the environment on galaxy evolution; and (c) the refinement of cosmological parameters using the spatial and redshift distribution of low-bias gas-rich galaxies. For context we provide an overview of recent and planned large-scale HI surveys. Combined with existing and new multi-wavelength sky surveys, WALLABY will enable an exciting new generation of panchromatic studies of the Local Universe. — First results from the WALLABY pilot survey
are revealed, with initial data products publicly available in the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA).},

	abstract = {We study the mutual alignment of radio sources within two surveys, Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimetres (FIRST) and TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS). This is done by producing two position angle catalogues containing the preferential directions of respectively 30 059 and 11 674 extended sources distributed over more than 7000 and 17 000 deg2. The identification of the sources in the FIRST sample was performed in advance by volunteers of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) project, while for the TGSS sample it is the result of an automated process presented here. After taking into account systematic effects, marginal evidence of a local alignment on scales smaller than 2.5 deg is found in the FIRST sample. The probability of this happening by chance is found to be less than 2 per cent. Further study suggests that on scales up to 1.5 deg the alignment is maximal. For one third of the sources, the RGZ volunteers identified an optical counterpart. Assuming a flat Λ cold dark matter cosmology with \${\textbackslash}Omega \_m = 0.31, {\textbackslash}Omega \_{\textbackslash}Lambda = 0.69\$, we convert the maximum angular scale on which alignment is seen into a physical scale in the range [19, 38] Mpc \$h\_\{70\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. This result supports recent evidence reported by Taylor and Jagannathan of radio jet alignment in the 1.4 deg2 ELAIS N1 field observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. The TGSS sample is found to be too sparsely populated to manifest a similar signal.},

We find a very significant effect for angular distances less than 1 degrees. The distance scale of alignment is found to be roughly 28 Mpc, in agreement with earlier estimates, assuming that these sources are dominantly at redshift of 0.8. However we are not able to entirely rule out the possibility of systematic bias in data. We also perform a full three dimensional analysis using a smaller data sample for which redshift information is available. In this case we only find a very weak signal at much larger distances.},

	abstract = {The reionization of the Universe ends the dark ages that started after the recombination era. In the case of H, reionization finishes around {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 6. Faint star-forming galaxies are the best candidate sources of the H-ionizing radiation, although active galactic nuclei may have also contributed. We have explored whether the termination regions of the jets from active galactic nuclei may have contributed significantly to the ionization of H in the late reionization epoch, around {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 6−7. We assumed that, as it has been proposed, active galactic nuclei at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 6 may have presented a high jet fraction, accretion rate, and duty cycle, and that non-thermal electrons contribute significantly to the pressure of jet termination regions. Empirical black-hole mass functions were adopted to characterize the population of active galactic nuclei. From all this, estimates were derived for the isotropic H-ionizing radiation produced in the jet termination regions, at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 6, through inverse Compton scattering off CMB photons. We find that the termination regions of the jets of active galactic nuclei may have radiated most of their energy in the form of H-ionizing radiation at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 6. For typical black-hole mass functions at that redshift, under the considered conditions (long-lasting, common, and very active galactic nuclei with jets), the contribution of these jets to maintain (and possibly enhance) the ionization of H may have been non-negligible. We conclude that the termination regions of jets from active galactic nuclei could have had a significant role in the reionization of the Universe at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≳ 6.},

Thus, improving the qualities of labels and learning models plays a key role in learning from the crowdsourced labeled data. In this survey, we first introduce the basic concepts of the qualities of labels and learning models. Then, by reviewing recently proposed models and algorithms on ground truth inference and learning models, we analyze connections and distinctions among these techniques as well as clarify the level of the progress of related researches. In order to facilitate the studies in this field, we also introduce open accessible real-world data sets collected from crowdsourcing systems and open source libraries and tools.

	abstract = {High-redshift radio galaxies present signs of both star formation and AGN activity, making them ideal candidates to investigate the connection and coevolution of AGN and star formation in the progenitors of present-day massive galaxies. We make use of a sample of 11 powerful radio galaxies spanning 1 {\textless}{\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless} 4 which have complete coverage of their spectral energy distribution (SED) from UV to FIR wavelengths. Using {\textless}i{\textgreater}Herschel{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data, we disentangle the relative contribution of the AGN and star formation by combining the galaxy evolution code PÉGASE.3 with an AGN torus model. We find that three components are necessary to reproduce the observed SEDs: an evolved and massive stellar component, a submm bright young starburst, and an AGN torus. We find that powerful radio galaxies form at very high-redshift, but experience episodic and important growth at 1 {\textless}{\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless} 4 as the mass of the associated starburst varies from 5 to 50\% of the total mass of the system. The properties of star formation differ from source to source, indicating no general trend of the star formation properties in the most infrared luminous high-redshift radio galaxies and no correlation with the AGN bolometric luminosity. Moreover, we find that AGN scattered light have a very limited impact on broad-band SED fitting on our sample. Finally, our analysis also suggests a wide range in origins for the observed star formation,which we partially constrain for some sources.},
