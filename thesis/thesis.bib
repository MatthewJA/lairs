	abstract = {We present a stationary, axisymmetric, self-similar semi-analytic model of magnetically dominated jet plasma based on force-free regions of a relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We use this model to illustrate how the composition of relativistic jet plasma can be determined, with special attention to the example of M87. In particular, we compute synthetic Stokes maps in e-e+p plasmas with various positron-to-proton ratios using synchrotron emission models scaling the partial pressure of electrons and positrons emitting at the observed frequency to the magnetic pressure, taking into account Faraday rotation and conversion. The lepton-dominated models produce bilaterally asymmetric radio intensity profiles with strong linear polarization and Stokes Q and U maps that are bilaterally asymmetric (but strongly up-down correlated) and antisymmetric (and sometimes up-down anticorrelated), respectively. The hadronic models produce more centrally brightened intensity and polarization maps. Circular polarization provides the cleanest observational tool for distinguishing the plasmas, as it increases outward from the jet core and central axis for highly ionic plasma, and is suppressed for pair dominated plasma. We find a measurable degree of circular polarization V/I of O(10e-3) for sub-equipartition hadronic jet plasmas. Our stationary model predicts that the intensity-normalized autocorrelation functions of Q and U increase and decrease with frequency, respectively. On the other hand, the autocorrelation of V is less sensitive to the frequency. Multi-band polarimetric observations could therefore be used as a novel probe of the composition of jet plasma.},

This training set is located in a ∼700 deg2 area of the KiDS South ﬁeld and is randomly selected and nearly complete at r {\textless} 19.5. We investigate the photometric redshift performance obtained with ugriz photometry from VSTATLAS and W1/W2 from WISE, based on several empirical and template methods. The best redshift errors are obtained with kernel-density estimation, as are the lowest biases, which are consistent with zero within statistical noise. The 68th percentiles of the redshift scatter for magnitude-limited samples at r {\textless} (15.5, 17.5, 19.5) are (0.014, 0.017, 0.028). In this magnitude range, there are no known ambiguities in the colour-redshift map, consistent with a small rate of redshift outliers. In the fainter regime, the KDE method produces p(z) estimates per galaxy that represent unbiased and accurate redshift frequency expectations. The p(z) sum over any subsample is consistent with the true redshift frequency plus Poisson noise. Further improvements in redshift precision at r {\textless} 20 would mostly be expected from ﬁlter sets with narrower passbands to increase the sensitivity of colours to small changes in redshift.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10537},
	abstract = {Galaxy morphology is a fundamental quantity, that is essential not only for the full spectrum of galaxy-evolution studies, but also for a plethora of science in observational cosmology. While a rich literature exists on morphological-classification techniques, the unprecedented data volumes, coupled, in some cases, with the short cadences of forthcoming 'Big-Data' surveys (e.g. from the LSST), present novel challenges for this field. Large data volumes make such datasets intractable for visual inspection (even via massively-distributed platforms like Galaxy Zoo), while short cadences make it difficult to employ techniques like supervised machine-learning, since it may be impractical to repeatedly produce training sets on short timescales. Unsupervised machine learning, which does not require training sets, is ideally suited to the morphological analysis of new and forthcoming surveys. Here, we employ an algorithm that performs clustering of graph representations, in order to group image patches with similar visual properties and objects constructed from those patches, like galaxies. We implement the algorithm on the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru-Strategic-Program Ultra-Deep survey, to autonomously reduce the galaxy population to a small number (160) of 'morphological clusters', populated by galaxies with similar morphologies, which are then benchmarked using visual inspection. The morphological classifications (which we release publicly) exhibit a high level of purity, and reproduce known trends in key galaxy properties as a function of morphological type at z{\textless}1 (e.g. stellar-mass functions, rest-frame colours and the position of galaxies on the star-formation main sequence). Our study demonstrates the power of unsupervised machine learning in performing accurate morphological analysis, which will become indispensable in this new era of deep-wide surveys.},

We detect 958 radio sources in Stokes I of which 136 are detected in polarization. We present the Euclidean-normalized polarized differential source counts down to 400 μJy. These counts indicate that sources have a higher degree of fractional polarization at fainter Stokes I flux density levels than for brighter sources, confirming an earlier result. We find that the majority of our polarized sources are steep-spectrum objects with a mean spectral index of –0.77, and there is no correlation between fractional polarization and spectral index. We also matched deep field sources to counterparts in the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters catalog. Of the polarized sources, 77\% show structure at the arcsecond scale whereas only 38\% of the sources with no detectable polarization show such structure. The median fractional polarization for resolved sources is 6.8\%, while it is 4.4\% for compact objects. The polarized radio sources in our deep field are predominantly those sources which are resolved and show the highest degrees of fractional polarization, indicating that the lobe dominated structure may be the source of the highly polarized sources. These resolved radio galaxies dominate the polarized source counts at mJy.},

Conversely, finding unexpected objects or phenomena within such large volumes of data presents a challenge that may best be solved using computational and statistical approaches. We present the application of a coarse-grained complexity measure for identifying interesting observations in large astronomical data sets. This measure, which has been termed apparent complexity, has been shown to model human intuition and perceptions of complexity. Apparent complexity is computationally efficient to derive and can be used to segment and identify interesting observations in very large data sets based on their morphological complexity. We show, using data from the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey, that apparent complexity can be combined with clustering methods to provide an automated process for distinguishing between images of galaxies which have been classified as having simple and complex morphologies. The approach generalizes well when applied to new data after being calibrated on a smaller data set, where it performs better than tested classification methods using pixel data. This generalizability positions apparent complexity as a suitable machine-learning feature for identifying complex observations with unanticipated features.},

Existing structured prediction approaches have signiﬁcant drawbacks when applied under the constraints of perfect bipartite matchings. Exponential family probabilistic models, such as the conditional random ﬁeld (CRF), provide statistical consistency guarantees, but suffer computationally from the need to compute the normalization term of its distribution over matchings, which is a \#P-hard matrix permanent computation. In contrast, the structured support vector machine (SSVM) provides computational efﬁciency, but lacks Fisher consistency, meaning that there are distributions of data for which it cannot learn the optimal matching even under ideal learning conditions (i.e., given the true distribution and selecting from all measurable potential functions). We propose adversarial bipartite matching to avoid both of these limitations.

This Very Large Telescope (VLA) survey reaches a detection sensitivity of 1 mJy at 20 cm over a final footprint of 10,575 deg2 that is largely coincident with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) area. Both the images and a catalog containing 946,432 sources are available through the FIRST Web site (http://sundog.stsci.edu). We record here the authoritative survey history, including hardware and software changes that affect the catalog's reliability and completeness. In particular, we use recent observations taken with the JVLA to test various aspects of the survey data (astrometry, CLEAN bias, and the flux density scale). We describe a new, sophisticated algorithm for flagging potential sidelobes in this snapshot survey, and show that fewer than 10\% of the cataloged objects are likely sidelobes, and that these are heavily concentrated at low flux densities and in the vicinity of bright sources, as expected. We also report a comparison of the survey with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), as well as a match of the FIRST catalog to the SDSS and Two Micron Sky Survey (2MASS) sky surveys. The NVSS match shows very good consistency in flux density scale and astrometry between the two surveys. The matches with 2MASS and SDSS indicate a systematic ∼10-20 mas astrometric error with respect to the optical reference frame in all VLA data that has disappeared with the advent of the JVLA. We demonstrate strikingly different behavior between the radio matches to stellar objects and to galaxies in the optical and IR surveys reflecting the different radio populations present over the flux density range 1-1000 mJy. As the radio flux density declines, stellar counterparts (quasars) get redder and fainter, while galaxies get brighter and have colors that initially redden but then turn bluer near the FIRST detection limit. Implications for future radio sky surveys are also briefly discussed. In particular, we show that for radio source identification at faint optical magnitudes, high angular resolution observations are essential, and cannot be sacrificed in exchange for high signal-to-noise data. The value of a JVLA survey as a complement to Square Kilometer Array precursor surveys is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {We present a broadband spectropolarimetric survey of 563 discrete, 
mostly unresolved radio sources between 1.3 and 2.0 GHz using data taken
with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We have used
rotation-measure synthesis to identify Faraday-complex polarized
sources, those objects whose frequency-dependent polarization behavior
indicates the presence of material possessing complicated magnetoionic
structure along the line of sight (LOS). For sources classified as
Faraday-complex, we have analyzed a number of their radio and
multiwavelength properties to determine whether they differ from
Faraday-simple polarized sources (sources for which LOS magnetoionic
structures are comparatively simple) in these properties. We use this
information to constrain the physical nature of the magnetoionic
structures responsible for generating the observed complexity. We detect
Faraday complexity in 12\% of polarized sources at ∼1‧
resolution, but we demonstrate that underlying signal-to-noise
limitations mean the true percentage is likely to be significantly
higher in the polarized radio source population. We find that the
properties of Faraday-complex objects are diverse, but that complexity
is most often associated with depolarization of extended radio sources
possessing a relatively steep total intensity spectrum. We find an
association between Faraday complexity and LOS structure in the Galactic
interstellar medium (ISM) and claim that a significant proportion of the
Faraday complexity we observe may be generated at interfaces of the ISM
associated with ionization fronts near neutral hydrogen structures.
Galaxy cluster environments and internally generated Faraday complexity
provide possible alternative explanations in some cases.},

	abstract = {Faraday rotation occurs along every line of sight in the Galaxy; rotation measure (RM) synthesis allows a 3D representation of the interstellar magnetic field. This study uses data from the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey, a combination of single-antenna spectro-polarimetric studies, including northern sky data from the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) 26 m telescope (1270-1750 MHz) and southern sky data from the Parkes 64 m telescope (300-480 MHz). From the synthesized Faraday spectral cubes we compute the zeroth, first, and second moments to find the total polarized emission, mean RM, and RM width of the polarized emission. From DRAO first moments we find a weak vertical field directed from Galactic North to South, but Parkes data reveal fields directed toward the Sun at high latitudes in both hemispheres: the two surveys clearly sample different volumes. DRAO second moments show feature widths in Faraday spectra increasing with decreasing positive latitudes, implying that longer lines of sight encounter more Faraday rotating medium, but this is not seen at negative latitudes. Parkes data show the opposite: at positive latitudes the second moment decreases with decreasing latitude, but not at negative latitudes. Comparing first moments with RMs of pulsars and extragalactic sources and a study of depolarization together confirm that the DRAO survey samples to larger distances than the Parkes data. Emission regions in the DRAO survey are typically 700-1000 pc away, slightly beyond the scale height of the magneto-ionic medium; emission detected in the Parkes survey is entirely within the magneto-ionic disk, less than 500 pc away.},

We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classiﬁcation scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus–H II (AGN–H II) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [O III] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [O III] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[O III]/σ 4, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we ﬁnd that at ﬁxed L[O III]/σ 4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/LEDD and Seyferts dominant at high L/LEDD. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation ﬁeld with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.},

local universe (z≲ 0.1) can be described by two separate,
mass-independent Eddington ratio distribution functions (ERDFs). We
assume that black holes can be divided into two independent groups:
those with radiatively efficient accretion, primarily hosted by
optically blue and green galaxies, and those with radiatively
inefficient accretion, which are mainly found in red galaxies. With
observed galaxy stellar mass functions as input, we show that the
observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity functions can be
reproduced by using mass-independent, broken power-law-shaped ERDFs. We
use the observed hard X-ray and 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions to
constrain the ERDF for radiatively efficient and inefficient AGNs,
respectively. We also test alternative ERDF shapes and mass-dependent
models. Our results are consistent with a mass-independent AGN fraction
and AGN hosts being randomly drawn from the galaxy population. We argue
that the ERDF is not shaped by galaxy-scale effects, but by how
efficiently material can be transported from the inner few parsecs to
the accretion disc. Our results are incompatible with the simplest form
of mass quenching where massive galaxies host higher accretion rate
AGNs. Furthermore, if reaching a certain Eddington ratio is a sufficient
condition for maintenance mode, it can occur in all red galaxies, not
just the most massive ones.},

We introduce the rotation measure transfer function (RMTF), which is an excellent predictor of nπ ambiguity problems with the λ2 coverage. Rotation measure synthesis can be implemented very eﬃciently on modern computers. Because the analysis is easily applied to wide ﬁelds, one can conduct very fast RM surveys of weak spatially extended sources. Diﬃcult situations, for example multiple sources along the line of sight, are easily detected and transparently handled. Under certain conditions, it is even possible to recover the emission as a function of Faraday depth within a single cloud of ionized gas. Rotation measure synthesis has already been successful in discovering widespread, weak, polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster (de Bruyn \& Brentjens 2005). In simple, high signal to noise situations it is as good as traditional linear ﬁts to χ versus λ2 plots. However, when the situation is more complex or very weak polarized emission at high rotation measures is expected, it is the only viable option.},

This represents a break from the steeper slopes at higher ﬂux densities, resulting in fewer sources predicted for future surveys with the Square Kilometer Array and its precursors. It provides a signiﬁcant challenge for using background rotation measures (RMs) to study clusters of galaxies or individual galaxies. Most of the polarized sources are well above our detection limit, and they are also radio galaxies that are well-resolved even at 10 , with redshifts from ∼0.2–1.9. We determined a total polarized ﬂux for each source by integrating the 10 polarized intensity maps, as will be done by upcoming surveys such as POSSUM. These total polarized ﬂuxes are a factor of two higher, on average, than the peak polarized ﬂux at 1.6; this would increase the number counts by ∼50\% at a ﬁxed ﬂux level. The detected sources have RMs with a characteristic rms scatter of ∼11 rad m−2 around the local Galactic value, after eliminating likely outliers. The median fractional polarization from all total intensity sources does not continue the trend of increasing at lower ﬂux densities, as seen for stronger sources. The changes in the polarization characteristics seen at these low ﬂuxes likely represent the increasing dominance of star-forming galaxies.},

	abstract = {The dominant source of radio emission from quasars has been debated for decades. We present the radio luminosity function (RLF) of optically-selected quasars below 1 mJy, constructed by applying a Bayesian-ﬁtting stacking technique to objects below the nominal radio ﬂux-density limit. We test the technique using simulated data, conﬁrming that we can reconstruct the RLF over three orders of magnitude below the typical 5σ threshold, although this is dependent on the number density of the population in question. We apply our method to 1.4-GHz ﬂux-densities from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey, extracted at the positions of optical quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7) over seven redshift bins. The lowest redshift bin (0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.45) constitutes a volume-limited sampled deﬁned by Mi {\textless} −23 and we measure the optically-selected quasar RLF over two orders of magnitude below the FIRST detection threshold of 1 mJy. We ﬁnd that our measured RLF is in agreement with deeper data from the literature. We ﬁnd that the radio luminosity function for the radio-loud quasars ﬂattens around log10[L1.4/W Hz−1] ≈ 25, where radio-quiet quasars start to emerge. The radio luminosity were radio-quiet quasars emerge coincides with the luminosity where star-forming galaxies start to dominate the radio source counts. This implies that there could be a signiﬁcant contribution from star formation in the host galaxies, but additional data is required to investigate this further. The higher-redshift bins show similar behaviour (i.e. RLF shape) as for the lowest-z bin, at least up to z = 2.15, implying that the same physical process may be responsible.},

In particular, we are concerned with big data applications where there are sufficient in-control data that can be used to specify certain quantiles of interest which, in turn, are used to assess whether the new, incoming data to be monitored are in control. The distribution-free chart is shown to lose very little power against the Shewhart charts designed for normally distributed data. The proposed charts offer a practical and robust alternative to the classical Shewhart charts which assume normality, particularly when monitoring quantiles and the data distribution is skewed. The effect of the size of the reference sample is examined on the assumption that the quantiles are known. Conclusions and recommendations are offered.},

	abstract = {We present the Influence Flower, a new visual metaphor for the influence profile of academic entities, including people, projects, institutions, conferences, and journals. While many tools quantify influence, we aim to expose the flow of influence between entities. The Influence Flower is an ego-centric graph, with a query entity placed in the centre. The petals are styled to reflect the strength of influence to and from other entities of the same or different type. For example, one can break down the incoming and outgoing influences of a research lab by research topics. The Influence Flower uses a recent snapshot of Microsoft Academic Graph, consisting of 212million authors, their 176 million publications, and 1.2 billion citations. An interactive web app, Influence Map, is constructed around this central metaphor for searching and curating visualisations. We also propose a visual comparison method that highlights change in influence patterns over time. We demonstrate through several case studies that the Influence Flower supports data-driven inquiries about the following: researchers' careers over time; paper(s) and projects, including those with delayed recognition; the interdisciplinary profile of a research institution; and the shifting topical trends in conferences. We also use this tool on influence data beyond academic citations, by contrasting the academic and Twitter activities of a researcher.},

In order to characterize and purify the extragalactic data set, we use external GAMA and Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic information to define quasar and star loci in multicolor space, aiding the removal of contamination from our extended source catalog. After appropriate data cleaning, we obtain a deep wide-angle galaxy sample that is approximately 95\% pure and 90\% complete at high Galactic latitudes. The catalog contains close to 20 million galaxies over almost 70\% of the sky, outside the Zone of Avoidance and other confused regions, with a mean surface density of more than 650 sources per square degree. Using multiwavelength information from two optical and two mid-IR photometric bands, we derive photometric redshifts for all the galaxies in the catalog, using the ANNz framework trained on the final GAMA-II spectroscopic data. Our sample has a median redshift of \{z\}\{med\}=0.2, with a broad \{dN\}/\{dz\} reaching up to z {\textgreater} 0.4. The photometric redshifts have a mean bias of {\textbar} δ z{\textbar} ˜ \{10\}-3, a normalized scatter of σ z = 0.033, and less than 3\% outliers beyond 3σ z . Comparison with external data sets shows no significant variation of photo-z quality with sky position. Together with the overall statistics, we also provide a more detailed analysis of photometric redshift accuracy as a function of magnitudes and colors. The final catalog is appropriate for "all-sky" three-dimensional (3D) cosmology to unprecedented depths, in particular through cross-correlations with other large-area surveys. It should also be useful for source preselection and identification in forthcoming surveys, such as TAIPAN or WALLABY.},

	abstract = {Future radio surveys will generate catalogs of tens of millions of radio sources, for which redshift estimates will be essential to achieve many of the science goals. However, spectroscopic data will be available for only a small fraction of these sources, and in most cases even the optical and infrared photometry will be of limited quality. Furthermore, radio sources tend to be at higher redshift than most optical sources (most radio surveys have a median redshift greater than 1) and so a significant fraction of radio sources hosts differ from those for which most photometric redshift templates are designed. We therefore need to develop new techniques for estimating the redshifts of radio sources. As a starting point in this process, we evaluate a number of machine-learning techniques for estimating redshift, together with a conventional template-fitting technique. We pay special attention to how the performance is affected by the incompleteness of the training sample and by sparseness of the parameter space or by limited availability of ancillary multiwavelength data. As expected, we find that the quality of the photometric-redshift degrades as the quality of the photometry decreases, but that even with the limited quality of photometry available for all-sky-surveys, useful redshift information is available for the majority of sources, particularly at low redshift. We find that a template-fitting technique performs best in the presence of high-quality and almost complete multi-band photometry, especially if radio sources that are also X-ray emitting are treated separately, using specific templates and priors. When we reduced the quality of photometry to match that available for the EMU all-sky radio survey, the quality of the template-fitting degraded and became comparable to some of the machine-learning methods. Machine learning techniques currently perform better at low redshift than at high redshift, because of incompleteness of the currently available training data at high redshifts.},

distribution rather than a vector embedding. In particular, this distribution
is supported over the contexts which co-occur with the entity and are embedded

learning from the perspective of Optimal Transport and take advantage of its
tools such as Wasserstein distance and barycenters. We elaborate how the method
can be applied for obtaining unsupervised representations of text and
illustrate the performance (quantitatively as well as qualitatively) on tasks
such as measuring sentence similarity, word entailment and similarity, where we
empirically observe significant gains (e.g., 4.1\% relative improvement over
Sent2vec, GenSen).
  The key benefits of the proposed approach include: (a) capturing uncertainty
and polysemy via modeling the entities as distributions, (b) utilizing the
underlying geometry of the particular task (with the ground cost), (c)
simultaneously providing interpretability with the notion of optimal transport

cross-comparing the data from the first data release (DR1) of the LOFAR
Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
DR7 main galaxy spectroscopic sample. The LoTSS DR1 provides deep data
(median rms noise of 71 μJy at 150 MHz) over 424 square degrees of
sky, which is sufficient to detect 10 615 (32 per cent) of the SDSS
galaxies over this sky area. An improved method to separate active
galactic nuclei (AGN) accurately from sources with radio emission
powered by star formation (SF) is developed and applied, leading to a
sample of 2121 local (z {\textless} 0.3) radio AGN. The local 150 MHz
luminosity function is derived for radio AGN and SF galaxies separately,
and the good agreement with previous studies at 1.4 GHz suggests that
the separation method presented is robust. The prevalence of radio AGN
activity is confirmed to show a strong dependence on both stellar and
black hole masses, remarkably reaching a fraction of 100 per cent of the
most massive galaxies ({\textgreater} 1011 M⊙)
displaying radio-AGN activity with L150 MHz ≥
1021 W Hz-1; thus, the most massive galaxies are
always switched on at some level. The results allow the full
Eddington-scaled accretion rate distribution (a proxy for the duty
cycle) to be probed for massive galaxies, and this accretion rate is
found to peak at Lmech/LEdd ≈ 10-5.
More than 50 per cent of the energy is released during the ≤2 per
cent of the time spent at the highest accretion rates,
Lmech/LEdd {\textgreater} 10-2.5. Stellar mass is
shown to be a more important driver of radio-AGN activity than black
hole mass, suggesting a possible connection between the fuelling gas and
the surrounding halo. This result is in line with models in which these
radio AGN are essential for maintaining the quenched state of galaxies
at the centres of hot gas haloes.},

which have typical stellar masses within 3 × (1010 -

field, we derived the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions for radio AGN
(L1.4 GHz 1022 - 1027 W
Hz-1) out to z 5. We constrained the evolution of this
population via continuous models of pure density and pure luminosity
evolutions, and we found best-fit parametrizations of
Φ∗ ∝ (1 + z)(2.00 ± 0.18) - (0.60
± 0.14)z, and L∗ ∝ (1 + z)(2.88
± 0.82) - (0.84 ± 0.34)z, respectively, with a
turnover in number and luminosity densities of the population at z ≈
1.5. We converted 1.4 GHz luminosity to kinetic luminosity taking
uncertainties of the scaling relation used into account. We thereby
derived the cosmic evolution of the kinetic luminosity density provided
by the AGN and compared this luminosity density to the radio-mode AGN
feedback assumed in the Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) model,
I.e., to the redshift evolution of the central supermassive black hole
accretion luminosity taken in the model as the source of heating that
offsets the energy losses of the cooling, hot halo gas, and thereby
limits further stellar mass growth of massive galaxies. We find that the
kinetic luminosity exerted by our radio AGN may be high enough to
balance the radiative cooling of the hot gas at each cosmic epoch since
z 5. However, although our findings support the idea of radio-mode AGN
feedback as a cosmologically relevant process in massive galaxy
formation, many simplifications in both the observational and
semi-analytic approaches still remain and need to be resolved before
robust conclusions can be reached.},

We show that neglecting various loss processes can introduce a systematic bias in the jet powers inferred from radio luminosities for a sample of radio galaxies. This bias can be corrected for by considering source size as well as radio luminosity; effectively the source size acts as a proxy for source age. Based on a sample of Fanaroff–Riley Type II radio sources with jet powers derived from the measured hotspot parameters, we empirically determine a new expression for jet power that accounts for the source size, (Qjet/1036 W) = 1.5+−10..88(L151/1027 W Hz−1)0.8(1 + z)1.0(D/kpc)0.58±0.17, where D is source size and L151 the 151 MHz radio luminosity. By comparing a ﬂux-limited and volume-limited sample, we show that any derived radio-luminosity–jet-power relation depends sensitively on sample properties, in particular the source size distribution and the size–luminosity correlation inherent in the sample. Such bias will affect the accuracy of the kinetic luminosity function derived from lobe radio luminosities and should be treated with caution.},

Although separating AGN from star-forming galaxies remains challenging, the combination of spectroscopic and photometric techniques we used gives us one of the largest available samples of candidate RLAGN. We used the sample, combined with recently developed analytical models, to investigate the lifetime distribution of RLAGN. We show that large or giant powerful RLAGN are probably the old tail of the general RLAGN population, but that the low-luminosity RLAGN candidates in our sample, many of which have sizes {\textless}100 kpc, either require a very diﬀerent lifetime distribution or have diﬀerent jet physics from the more powerful objects. We then used analytical models to develop a method of estimating jet kinetic powers for our candidate objects and constructed a jet kinetic luminosity function based on these estimates. These values can be compared to observational quantities, such as the integrated radiative luminosity of groups and clusters, and to the predictions from models of RLAGN feedback in galaxy formation and evolution. In particular, we show that RLAGN in the local Universe are able to supply all the energy required per comoving unit volume to counterbalance X-ray radiative losses from groups and clusters and thus prevent the hot gas from cooling. Our computation of the kinetic luminosity density of local RLAGN is in good agreement with other recent observational estimates and with models of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {Methods. We match radio emission from the NVSS and SUMSS surveys to galaxies of the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS) using an image-level algorithm that properly treats the extended structure of radio sources.
Results. The bright master sample we present contains 575 radio-emitting galaxies with a ﬂux greater than 213 mJy at 1.4 GHz. Over 30\% of the galaxies in our catalog are not contained in existing large-area extra-galactic radio samples. We compute the optical and radio luminosity functions and the fraction of radio galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity. 94\% of the radio galaxies within z = 0.03 are of Hubble type E/S0. The local galaxy density in a sphere of 2 Mpc centered on the radio galaxies is 1.7 times higher than around non-radio galaxies of the same luminosity and morphology, which is a statistically signiﬁcant enhancement ({\textgreater}3σ).
Conclusions. Our sample presents the deepest all-sky catalog of low-power radio galaxies. The observed enhancement of the galaxy density around radio galaxies suggests a causal relation between external galaxy properties, such as environment or merger history, and the formation of powerful jets in the present universe. Since the enhancement is observed with respect to galaxies of the same luminosity and Hubble type, it is not primarily driven by black hole mass. Our automated matching procedure is found to select radio-emitting galaxies with high eﬃciency (99\%) and purity (91\%), which is key for future processing of deeper, larger samples.},

A distance metric must then be established to measure the dissimilarities between different signal features. Due to the natural characteristics of dynamic systems, the power spectral density (PSD) of a signal is often used as a feature to facilitate classification. We reason in this paper that PSD matrices have structural constraints and that they describe a manifold in the signal space. Thus, instead of the widely used Euclidean distance (ED), a more appropriate measure is the Riemannian distance (RD) on the manifold. Here, we develop closed-form expressions of the RD between two PSD matrices on the manifold and study some of the properties. We further show how an optimum weighting matrix can be developed for the application of RD to signal classification. These new distance measures are then applied to the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for the determination of sleep states and the results are highly encouraging.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian recursion relations which describe the behavior of the a posteriori probability density function of the state of a time-discrete stochastic system conditioned on available measurement data cannot generally be solved in closed-form when the system is either non-linear or nongaussian. In this paper a density approximation involving convex combinations of gaussian density functions is introduced and proposed as a meaningful way of circumventing the difficulties encountered in evaluating these relations and in using the resulting densities to determine specific estimation policies. It is seen that as the number of terms in the gaussian sum increases without bound, the approximation converges uniformly to any density function in a large class. Further, any finite sum is itself a valid density function unlike many other approximations that have been investigated. The problem of determining the a posteriori density and minimum variance estimates for linear systems with nongaussian noise is treated using the gaussian sum approximation. This problem is considered because it can be dealt with in a relatively straightforward manner using the approximation but still contains most of the difficulties that one encounters in considering non-linear systems since the a posteriori density is nongaussian. After discussing the general problem from the point-of-view of applying gaussian sums, a numerical example is presented in which the actual statistics of the a posteriori density are compared with the values predicted by the gaussian sum and by the Kalman filter approximations.
Résumé
Les relations recurrentes bayesiennes qui décrivent le comportement de la fonction de densité de probabilité a posteriori de l'état d'un système aléatoire, discret dans le temps, en se basant sur les données des mesures disponibles, ne peuvent être généralement resolues sous une forme fermee lorsque le système est soit non-linéaire, soit non-gaussien. Le present article introduit et propose une approximation de densité, mettant en jeu des combinaisons convexes de fonctions de densité gaussiennes, à titre de méthode efficace pour éviter les difficultes rencontrées dans l'évaluation de ces relations et dans l'utilisation des densités en résultant pour determiner des stratégies d'évaluation particulières. Il est montré que, lorsque le nombre de termes de la somme gaussienne augmente sans limites, l'approximation converge uniformement vers une fonction de densité quelconque dans une catégorie étendue. De plus, toute somme finie est ellemême une fonction de densité valable, d'une manière différente des nombreuses autres approximations étudiées dans le passé. Le problème de la determination des estimations de la densité a posteriori et de la variance minimale pour des systèmes linéaires avec bruit non-gaussien est traité en utilisant l'approximation des sommes gaussiennes. Ce problème est étudié parce qu'il peut être traité d'une manière relativement simple en utilisant l'approximation mais contient encore la plupart des difficultés rencontrées en considérant des systèmes non-linéaires, puisque la densité a posteriori est non-gaussienne. Après la discussion du problème général du point de vue de l'application des sommes gaussiennes, l'article présente un exemple numérique dans lequel les statistiques réélles de la densité a posteriori sont comparées avec les valeurs prédites par les approximations des sommes gaussiennes et du filtre de Kalman.
Zusammenfassung
Die Bayes'schen Rekursionsbeziehungen, die das Verhalten der a priori-Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichtefunktion des Zustandes eines zeitdiskreten stochastischen Systems beschrieben, können nicht allgemein in geschlossener Form gelöst werden, wenn das System entweder nichtlinear oder nicht-gaussisch ist. In dieser Arbeit wird eine Dichteapproximation, die konvexe Kombinationen von Gauss'schen Dichtefunktionen enthält, eingeführt und als bedeutungsvoller Weg zur Umgehung der Schwierigkeiten vorgeschlagen, die sich bei der Auswertung dieser Beziehungen und bei der Benutzung der resultierenden Dichten ergeben, um die spezifische Schätzstrategie zu bestimmen. Ersichtlich konvergiert, da die Zahl der Terme in der Gauss'schen Summe unbegrenzt wächst, die Approximation gleichmäßig zu einer Dichtefunktion in einer umfassenden Klasse. Weiter ist eine endliche Summe selbst eine gültige Dichtefunktion, anders als viele andere schon untersuchte Approximationen. Das Problem der Bestimmung der Schätzungen der a posteriori-Dichte und des Varianzminimums für lineare Systeme mit nichtgauss'schem Geräusch wird unter Behandlung der Gauss'schen Summenapproximation behandelt. Dieses Problem wird betrachtet, weil es in einer relativ geraden Art unter Benutzung der Approximation behandelt werden kann, aber immer noch die meisten der Schwierigkeiten enthält, denen man bei der Betrachtung nichtlinearer Systeme begegnet, da die a posteriori-Dichte nichtgaussisch ist. Nach der Diskussion des allgemeinen Problems vom Gesichtspunkt der Anwendung Gauss'scher Summen, wird ein Zahlenbeispiel gebracht, in dem die aktuellen Statistiken der a posteriori-Dichte mit den Werten verglichen werde, die durch die Gauss'sche Summe und durch die Kalman-Filter-Approximationen vorhergesagt wurden.

	abstract = {The optimal source-ﬁnding strategy for linear polarization data is an unsolved problem, with many inhibitive factors imposed by the technically challenging nature of polarization observations. Such an algorithm is essential for Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathﬁnder surveys, such as the Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), as data volumes are signiﬁcant enough to prohibit manual inspection. We present a new strategy of ‘Faraday Moments’ for source-ﬁnding in linear polarization with LOFAR, using the moments of the frequency-dependent full-Stokes data (i.e. the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess kurtosis). Through simulations of the sky, we ﬁnd that moments can identify polarized sources with a high completeness: 98.5 per cent at a signal to noise of 5. While the method has low reliability, rotation measure (RM) synthesis can be applied per candidate source to ﬁlter out instrumental and spurious detections. This combined strategy will result in a complete and reliable catalogue of polarized sources that includes the full sensitivity of the observational bandwidth. We ﬁnd that the technique can reduce the number of pixels on which RM Synthesis needs to be performed by a factor of ≈1 × 105 for source distributions anticipated with modern radio telescopes. Through tests on LOFAR data, we ﬁnd that the technique works effectively in the presence of diffuse emission. Extensions of this method are directly applicable to other upcoming radio surveys such as the POlarization Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism with the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathﬁnder, and the SKA itself.},

This change fosters the development of data-driven science as a useful companion to the common model-driven data analysis paradigm, where astronomers develop automatic tools to mine datasets and extract novel information from them. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular among astronomers, and are now used for a wide variety of tasks. In light of these developments, and the promise and challenges associated with them, the IAC Winter School 2018 focused on big data in Astronomy, with a particular emphasis on machine learning and deep learning techniques. This document summarizes the topics of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms presented during the school, and provides practical information on the application of such tools to astronomical datasets. In this document I cover basic topics in supervised machine learning, including selection and preprocessing of the input dataset, evaluation methods, and three popular supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and shallow Artiﬁcial Neural Networks. My main focus is on unsupervised machine learning algorithms, that are used to perform cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and outlier detection. Unsupervised learning algorithms are of particular importance to scientiﬁc research, since they can be used to extract new knowledge from existing datasets, and can facilitate new discoveries.},

It is shown that a traditional LPC system can be viewed as a minimum distortion or nearest-neighbor system where the distortion measure is a minimum discrimination information between a speech process model and an observed frame of actual speech. This distortion measure is used in an algorithm for computer-aided design of block source codes subject to a fidelity criterion to obtain a 750-bits/s speech compression system that resembles an LPC system but has a much lower rate, a larger memory requirement, and requires no on-line LPC analysis. Quantitative and informal subjective comparisons are made among our system and LPC systems.},

This new method differs from previous methods in its explicit inclusion of a prior estimate of the power spectrum, and it reduces to maximum entropy spectral analysis as a special case. The prior estimate can be viewed as a means of shaping the spectral estimator. Cross-entropy minimization yields a family of shaped spectral estimators consistent with known autocorrelations. Results are derived in two equivalent ways: once by minimizing the cross-entropy of underlying probability densities, and once by arguments concerning the cross-entropy between the input and output of linear filters. Several example minimum cross-entropy spectra are included.},

The method takes advantage of the excellent spectral coverage provided by modern radio telescopes to reconstruct the intrinsic polarization properties along a line of sight, using a Fourier relationship between the observed polarization products and a function describing the intrinsic polarization (the Faraday dispersion function). An important consequence of the Fourier relationship and discrete frequency sampling is the need, in some cases, to deconvolve the sampling response from the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function. Practical aspects of the deconvolution procedure are discussed. We illustrate the use of the technique by summarizing a recent investigation carried out with the WSRT. We conclude by brieﬂy describing the applicability to future programs which will be carried out with the next generation of radio telescopes such as LOFAR.},

The present work is also an improvement of previous works, in the sense that the form of the approach is more eﬃcient, that is, a smaller relative error is obtained using a lower number of parameters. As in the Pade method rational functions are used with coeﬃcients determined from the powers series, but now also asymptotic expansions are also used simultaneously with that series, and consequently the rational functions have to be combined with elementary functions, in such a way, that the approach is a bridge between both expansions. The approximation now found is a rational function combined with a hyperbolic function. Only three parameters are needed to obtain a relative error smaller than 0.6 percent.},

In the domain of the Bragg peak there is a different physical behavior between both measurement methods.},

The presented algorithms work if Dm(x) is either an analytical function or only given in a numerical form. Some approximation methods of the deconvolution are compared (differential operator expansion to analytical adaptations of 2 × 2 cm2 and 4 ×4 cm2 proﬁles, Hermite expansions to measured 6 × 6 cm2 and 20 × 20 cm2 proﬁles and Bragg curves of 80/180 MeV protons, FFT to an analytical 4 × 4 cm2 proﬁle).

	abstract = {Computing accurate estimates of the Fourier transform of analog signals from discrete data points is important in many fields of science and engineering. The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel class of Gaussian processes (GPs) whose spectra have compact support, meaning that their sample trajectories are almost-surely band limited. As a complement to the growing literature on spectral design of covariance kernels, the core of our proposal is to model power spectral densities through a rectangular function, which results in a kernel based on the sinc function with straightforward extensions to non-centred (around zero frequency) and frequency-varying cases. In addition to its use in regression, the relationship between the sinc kernel and the classic theory is illuminated, in particular, the Shannon-Nyquist theorem is interpreted as posterior reconstruction under the proposed kernel. Additionally, we show that the sinc kernel is instrumental in two fundamental signal processing applications: ﬁrst, in stereo amplitude modulation, where the non-centred sinc kernel arises naturally. Second, for band-pass ﬁltering, where the proposed kernel allows for a Bayesian treatment that is robust to observation noise and missing data. The developed theory is complemented with illustrative graphic examples and validated experimentally using real-world data.},

An important application is in the banking industry, where statistical models are applied to loans to determine provisions and capital requirements. These models are developed on historical data, and regulations require their monitoring to ensure they remain valid on current portfolios\&mdash;often years since the models were developed. The Population Stability Index (PSI) is an industry standard to measure whether the distribution of the current data has shifted significantly from the distribution of data used to develop the model. This paper explores several disadvantages of the PSI and proposes the Prediction Accuracy Index (PAI) as an alternative. The superior properties and interpretation of the PAI are discussed and it is concluded that the PAI can more accurately summarise the level of population stability, helping risk analysts and managers determine whether the model remains fit-for-purpose.},

We present a new theorem which shows that “Bregman distortions” (employing a potentially non-convex generator) may be exactly re-written as a scaled Bregman divergence computed over transformed data. This property can be viewed from the standpoints of geometry (a scaled isometry with adaptive metrics) or convex optimization (relating generalized perspective transforms). Admissible distortions include geodesic distances on curved manifolds and projections or gauge-normalisation. Our theorem allows one to leverage to the wealth and convenience of Bregman divergences when analysing algorithms relying on the aforementioned Bregman distortions. We illustrate this with three novel applications of our theorem: a reduction from multi-class density ratio to class-probability estimation, a new adaptive projection free yet norm-enforcing dual norm mirror descent algorithm, and a reduction from clustering on ﬂat manifolds to clustering on curved manifolds. Experiments on each of these domains validate the analyses and suggest that the scaled Bregman theorem might be a worthy addition to the popular handful of Bregman divergence properties that have been pervasive in machine learning.},

describing measurements of the quadrature sum of Stokes Q and U

the probability density function and expectation value for Faraday-space
polarization measurements for both the case where true underlying
polarized emission is present within unresolved Faraday components, and
for the limiting case where no such emission is present. We then derive
relationships to quantify the statistical significance of linear
polarization measurements in terms of standard Gaussian statistics. The
formalism developed in this work will be useful for setting
signal-to-noise ratio detection thresholds for measurements of linear
polarization, for the analysis of polarized sources potentially
exhibiting multiple Faraday components and for the development of
polarization debiasing schemes.},

	abstract = {We have observed 37 bright, polarized radio sources with the Allen 
Telescope Array (ATA) to present a novel analysis of their Faraday
rotation properties. Each source was observed during the commissioning
phase with two to four 100 MHz bands at frequencies ranging from 1 to 2
GHz. These observations demonstrate how the continuous frequency
coverage of the ATA's log-periodic receiver can be applied to the study
of Faraday rotation measures (RMs). We use RM synthesis to show that
wide-bandwidth data can find multiple RM components toward a single
source. Roughly a quarter of the sources studied have extra RM
components with high confidence (brighter than ≈40 mJy), when
observing with an RM resolution of roughly 100 rad m-2. These
extra components contribute 10\%-70\% of the total polarized flux. This is
the first time multiple RM components have been identified in a large
sample of point sources. For our observing configuration, these extra RM
components bias the measurement of the peak RM by 10-15 rad
m-2 more generally, the peak RM cannot be determined more
precisely than the RM beam size. Comparing our 1-2 GHz RM spectra to
Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) polarimetric maps shows that both
techniques can identify complicated Faraday structures in the sources.
However, the RM values and fractional polarization are generally smaller
at lower frequencies than in the higher frequency VLBA maps. With a few
exceptions, the RMs from this work are consistent with that of earlier,
narrow-bandwidth, all-sky surveys. This work also describes the
polarimetry calibration procedure and that on-axis ATA observations of
linear polarization can be calibrated to an accuracy of 0.2\% of Stokes
I. Future research directions include studying the time-dependent RM
structure in active galactic nuclei and enabling accurate, wide-area RM
surveys to test models of Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields.},

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) was used to observe these
sources with 2 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth from 1.1 to 3.1 GHz. This
allowed us to spectrally resolve the polarization structure of spatially
unresolved radio sources, and by fitting various Faraday rotation models
to the data, we conclusively demonstrate that two of the sources cannot
be described by a simple rotation measure (RM) component modified by
depolarization from a foreground Faraday screen. Our results have
important implications for using background extragalactic radio sources
as probes of the Galactic and intergalactic magneto-ionic media as we
show how RM estimations from narrow-bandwidth observations can give
erroneous results in the presence of multiple interfering Faraday
components. We postulate that the additional RM components arise from
polarized structure in the compact inner regions of the radio source
itself and not from polarized emission from galactic or intergalactic
foreground regions. We further suggest that this may contribute
significantly to any RM time variability seen in RM studies on these
angular scales. Follow-up, high-sensitivity very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) observations of these sources will directly test
our predictions.},

	abstract = {An understanding of cosmic magnetism requires converting the polarization properties of extragalactic radio sources into the
rest-frame in which the corresponding polarized emission or Faraday rotation is produced. Motivated by this requirement, we present a catalog of multiwavelength linear polarization and total intensity radio data for polarized sources from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey. We cross-match these sources with a number of complementary
measurements—combining data from major radio polarization and
total intensity surveys such as AT20G, B3-VLA, GB6, NORTH6CM, Texas, and WENSS, together with other polarization data published over the last 50 years. For 951 sources, we present spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in both fractional polarization and total intensity, each containing between 3 and 56 independent measurements from 400 MHz to 100 GHz. We physically model these SEDs, and where available provide the redshift of the optical counterpart. For a superset of 25,649 sources we provide the total intensity spectral index, α. Objects with steep versus flat α generally have different polarization SEDs: steep-spectrum
sources exhibit depolarization, while flat-spectrum sources maintain constant polarized fractions over large ranges in wavelength. This suggests the run of polarized fraction with wavelength is predominantly affected by the local source environment, rather than by unrelated foreground magnetoionic material. In addition, a significant fraction (21\%) of sources exhibit "repolarization," which further suggests that polarized SEDs are affected by different emitting regions within the source, rather than by a particular depolarization law. This has implications for the physical interpretation of future broadband polarimetric surveys.},

We use a general-purpose, polarization model-fitting procedure that describes the Faraday rotation measure (RM) and intrinsic polarization structure of up to three distinct polarized emission regions or `RM components' of a source. Overall, 37 per cent/52 per cent/11 per cent of sources are best fitted by one/two/three RM components. However, these fractions are dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in polarization (more RM components more likely at higher S/N). In general, our analysis shows that sources with high integrated degrees of polarization at 1.4 GHz have low Faraday depolarization, are typically dominated by a single RM component, have a steep spectral index and have a high intrinsic degree of polarization. After classifying our sample into radiative-mode and jet-mode AGN, we find no significant difference between the Faraday rotation or Faraday depolarization properties of jet-mode and radiative-mode AGN. However, there is a statistically significant difference in the intrinsic degree of polarization between the two types, with the jet-mode sources having more intrinsically ordered magnetic field structures than the radiative-mode sources. We also find a preferred perpendicular orientation of the intrinsic magnetic field structure of jet-mode AGN with respect to the jet direction, while no clear preference is found for the radiative-mode sources.},

First we quantify the degradation of performance of a predictor which is designed for a particular spectral density function and then it is used to predict the values of a random process having a different spectral density. The logarithm of the ratio between the variance of the error, over the corresponding minimal (optimal) variance, produces a measure of distance between the two power spectra with several desirable properties. Analogous quantities based on smoothing problems produce alternative distances and suggest a class of measures based on fractions of generalized means of ratios of power spectral densities. These distance measures endow the manifold of spectral density functions with a (pseudo) Riemannian metric. We pursue one of the possible options for a distance measure, characterize the relevant geodesics, and compute corresponding distances.},

Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 μm data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 μm map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 μm DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 μm flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 μm map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} sr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at 140 μm and of 17 +/- 4 nW m{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} sr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at 240 μm (95\% confidence). This integrated flux {\textasciitilde}2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 μm emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

	abstract = {We have found the u-r color versus g-i color gradient space can be used for highly successful morphology classification of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. In this space, galaxies form well-separated early- and late-type branches. The location of galaxies along the branches reflects the degree and locality of star formation activity, and monotonically corresponds to the sequence of morphological subclasses. When the concentration index is also used, the completeness and reliability of classification reaches about 91\% for a training set of SDSS galaxies brighter than r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}pet{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}15.9. At the faintest magnitudes (r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}pet{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}17.5) of the SDSS spectroscopic sample, the accuracy still remains at about 88\%. The new classification scheme will help us find accurate relations of galaxy morphology with spatial and temporal environments, and help us to understand the origin of morphology of galaxies.},

	abstract = {With the advent of large scale-surveys the manual analysis and classification of individual radio source morphologies is rendered impossible as existing approaches do not scale. The analysis of complex morphological features in the spatial domain is a particularly important task. Here, we discuss the challenges of transferring crowdsourced labels obtained from the Radio Galaxy Zoo project and introduce a proper transfer mechanism via quantile random forest regression. By using parallelized rotation and flipping invariant Kohonen-maps, image cubes of Radio Galaxy Zoo selected galaxies formed from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) radio continuum and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) infrared all-sky surveys are first projected down to a two-dimensional embedding in an unsupervised way. This embedding can be seen as a discretized space of shapes with the coordinates reflecting morphological features as expressed by the automatically derived prototypes. We find that these prototypes have reconstructed physically meaningful processes across two channel images at radio and infrared wavelengths in an unsupervised manner. In the second step, images are compared with those prototypes to create a heat map, which is the morphological fingerprint of each object and the basis for transferring the user generated labels. These heat maps have reduced the feature space by a factor of 248, and are able to be used as the basis for subsequent machine-learning (ML) methods. Using an ensemble of decision trees we achieve upwards of 85.7\% and 80.7\% accuracy when predicting the number of components and peaks in an image, respectively, using these heat maps. We also question the currently used discrete classification schema and introduce a continuous scale that better reflects the uncertainty in transition between two classes, caused by sensitivity and resolution limits.},

	abstract = {Modern machine learning methods including deep learning have achieved great success in predictive accuracy for supervised learning tasks, but may still fall short in giving useful estimates of their predictive \{{\textbackslash}em uncertainty\}. Quantifying uncertainty is especially critical in real-world settings, which often involve input distributions that are shifted from the training distribution due to a variety of factors including sample bias and non-stationarity. In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted. Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous large-scale empirical comparison of these methods under dataset shift. We present a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art methods on classification problems and investigate the effect of dataset shift on accuracy and calibration. We find that traditional post-hoc calibration does indeed fall short, as do several other previous methods. However, some methods that marginalize over models give surprisingly strong results across a broad spectrum of tasks.},

	abstract = {Modern data sets in many applications no longer comprise samples of real vectors in a real vector space but samples of much more complex structures which may be represented as points in a space with certain underlying geometric structure, namely a manifold. Manifold learning is an emerging field for learning the underlying structure. The study of manifold learning can be split into two main branches, namely dimension reduction and manifold fitting. With the aim of interacting statistics and geometry, we tackle the problem of manifold fitting in the ambient space. Inspired by the relation between the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the geometry of a manifold, we aim to find a small set of points that preserve the geometry of the underlying manifold. Based on this relationship, we extend the idea of subsampling to noisy datasets in high dimensional space and utilize the Moving Least Squares (MLS) approach to approximate the underlying manifold. We analyze the two core steps in our proposed method theoretically and also provide the bounds for the MLS approach. Our simulation results and real data analysis demonstrate the superiority of our method in estimating the underlying manifold from noisy data.},

	abstract = {The distribution in space and both the optical and radio luminosity functions of quasi-stellar radio sources are derived The derivation is based on quasi-stellar sources in the Revised 3C Catalogue, in which they have been identified and observed with a high degree of completeness down to magnitude around 18k. The redshifts are assumed to be cosmological. The distribution in space is found to be strongly non-uniform. The space density, in co-moving coordinates, is increasing with redshift z, such that at z = 1 the density is around 150 and 80 times the local (z = 0) density, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively. This density increase corresponds to a N(S) relation quite {\textasciitilde}imi1ar to that exhibited by extragalactic radio sources. The optical luminosity function is relatively flat, i e., the numbers per magnitude depend little on the luminosity In contrast the radio luminosity function is rather steep, the number per magnitude increas- ing toward fainter radio luminosities by a factor of around three to four per magnitude. Extension of this radio luminosity function by 1{\textasciitilde} magnitude is sufficient to account for the Sandage-Luyten estimate of the sky density of quasi-stellar objects. The local (z = 0) density of quasi-stellar objects can then be estimated at 7 X 1O{\textasciitilde} and 12 X 1O-{\textasciitilde} Mpc3, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively.

The resulting catalog of RM values covers the sky area north of declination –40° with an average density of more than one RM per square degree. We present an image of the median RM over 82\% of the sky with a resolution of 8° and a typical error of ±1-2 rad m–2. The image shows large-scale structures in RM that extend to very high Galactic latitudes. A simple analysis of the RM structure at high Galactic latitudes is used to derive properties of the Galactic halo magnetic field in the solar neighborhood. We find the component of the local field perpendicular to the plane (the z-component) equal to +0.30 μG for z 0. The reversal of sign across the Galactic plane is consistent with a quadrupole field geometry for the poloidal component of the halo field. The halo magnetic field component parallel to the disk is also found to be antisymmetric and generally consistent with a toroidal field, with strength +0.83 μG for z 0. We have identified five regions of the sky where the foreground median RM is consistently less than 1 rad m–2 over several degrees. These holes in the foreground RM will be useful for future studies of possible small-scale fluctuations in cosmic magnetic field structures. In addition to allowing measurement of RMs toward polarized sources, the new analysis of the NVSS data removes the effects of bandwidth depolarization for {\textbar}RM{\textbar} ≳ 100 rad m–2 inherent in the original NVSS source catalog. This new catalog of RMs and polarized flux densities is available online, and will be a valuable resource for further studies of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetoionic medium, and extragalactic magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical
properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to
different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by
relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible
connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become
available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field. (SECTION: Invited Review Paper)},

Kilometre Array precursor located in Western Australia, we have
completed the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, and

of observations. The catalogue covers 24 831 square degrees, over
declinations south of +30° and Galactic latitudes outside 10° of
the Galactic plane, excluding some areas such as the Magellanic Clouds.
It contains 307 455 radio sources with 20 separate flux density
measurements across 72-231 MHz, selected from a time- and
frequency-integrated image centred at 200 MHz, with a resolution of
≈2 arcmin. Over the catalogued region, we estimate that the catalogue
is 90 per cent complete at 170 mJy, and 50 per cent complete at 55 mJy,
and large areas are complete at even lower flux density levels. Its
reliability is 99.97 per cent above the detection threshold of 5σ,
which itself is typically 50 mJy. These observations constitute the
widest fractional bandwidth and largest sky area survey at radio
frequencies to date, and calibrate the low-frequency flux density scale
of the southern sky to better than 10 per cent. This paper presents
details of the flagging, imaging, mosaicking and source
extraction/characterization, as well as estimates of the completeness
and reliability. All source measurements and images are available

	abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary Universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies with their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be divided into two distinct populations. The radiative-mode AGNs are associated with black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ∼1\% of the Eddington limit. They are primarily associated with less massive BHs growing in high-density pseudobulges at a rate sufﬁcient to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in ∼10 Gyr. The circumnuclear environment contains high-density cold gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outﬂows (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in their host bulge is signiﬁcant today. These AGNs are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still at play today.},

The book covers such topics as radiative transfer theory, relativistic covariance and kinematics, bremsstrahlung radiation, Compton scattering, some plasma effects, and radiative transitions in atoms. The discussion begins with first principles, physically motivating and deriving all results rather than merely presenting finished formulas. Much of the prerequisite material is provided by brief reviews, making the book a self-contained reference tool. Also included are about 75 problems with solutions, illustrating applications of the material and methods for calculating results},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the possibility that the structure of the largest radio galaxy J1420–0545 is formed by restarted rather than primary jet activity. This hypothesis is motivated by the unusual morphological properties of the source, suggesting almost ballistic propagation of powerful jets in a particularly low-density environment. New radio observations of J1420–0545 confirm its morphology, which consists of only two narrow lobes; no trace of any outer low-density cavity due to the previous jet activity is therefore detected. Different model fits performed using the newly accessed radio data imply a relatively young age of the source, exceptionally high expansion velocity, a large jet kinetic power, and confirm and particularly low-density environment. We find that it is possible to choose a realistic set of the model parameters for which the hypothetical outer lobes of J1420–0545 are old enough such that their expected radio surface brightness is substantially below the rms noise level of the available radio maps. On the other hand, the extremely low density of the gas surrounding the J1420–0545 lobes is consistent with the mean density of the baryonic matter in the universe. This suggests that the source may be instead located in a real void of the galaxy and matter distribution. In both cases, the giant radio lobes of J1420–0545 are expected to substantially modify the surrounding matter by driving strong shocks and heating the gas located at the outskirts of the filamentary galactic distribution. Finally, we also find that the energetic requirements for the source are severe in terms of the total jet power and the total energy deposited by the outflows far away from the central engine.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in developing diagnostics that discriminate individual mutagenic mechanisms in a range of applications that include identifying population-specific mutagenesis and resolving distinct mutation signatures in cancer samples. Analyses for these applications assume that mutagenic mechanisms have a distinct relationship with neighboring bases that allows them to be distinguished. Direct support for this assumption is limited to a small number of simple cases, e.g., CpG hypermutability. We have evaluated whether the mechanistic origin of a point mutation can be resolved using only sequence context for a more complicated case. We contrasted single nucleotide variants originating from the multitude of mutagenic processes that normally operate in the mouse germline with those induced by the potent mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). The considerable overlap in the mutation spectra of these two samples make this a challenging problem. Employing a new, robust log-linear modeling method, we demonstrate that neighboring bases contain information regarding point mutation direction that differs between the ENU-induced and spontaneous mutation variant classes. A logistic regression classifier exhibited strong performance at discriminating between the different mutation classes. Concordance between the feature set of the best classifier and information content analyses suggest our results can be generalized to other mutation classification problems. We conclude that machine learning can be used to build a practical classification tool to identify the mutation mechanism for individual genetic variants.
