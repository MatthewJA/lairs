          Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in
          China, data volumes and data rates are exponentially
          growing. This fact necessitates a focus on artificial
          intelligence (AI) technologies that can perform the
          automatic pulsar candidate identification to mine large
          astronomical data sets. Automatic pulsar candidate
          identification can be considered as a task of determining
          potential candidates for further investigation and
          eliminating noises of radio frequency interferences or
          other non-pulsar signals. It is very hard to raise the
          performance of DCNN-based pulsar identification because the
          limited training samples restrict network structure to be
          designed deep enough for learning good features as well as
          the crucial class imbalance problem due to very limited
          number of real pulsar samples. To address these problems,
          we proposed a framework which combines deep convolution
          generative adversarial network (DCGAN) with support vector
          machine (SVM) to deal with imbalance class problem and to
          improve pulsar identification accuracy. DCGAN is used as

          technique which not only can solve imbalance class problem
          but also can learn discriminative feature representations
          of pulsar candidates instead of computing hand-crafted
          features in preprocessing steps too, which makes it more
          accurate for automatic pulsar candidate selection.

          meaningful research topic in the field of radio astronomy.
          With the advent of astronomical instruments, the volume and
          rate of data acquisition have grown exponentially. This
          development necessitates a focus on artificial intelligence
          (AI) technologies that can mine large astronomical data
          sets. Automatic pulsar candidate identification (APCI) can
          be considered as a task determining potential candidates
          for further investigation and eliminating the noise of
          radio-frequency interference and other non-pulsar signals.
          As reported in the existing literature, AI techniques,
          especially convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
          techniques, have been adopted for APCI. However, it is
          challenging to enhance the performance of CNN-based pulsar
          identification because only an extremely limited number of
          real pulsar samples exist, which results in a crucial class
          imbalance problem. To address these problems, we propose a
          framework that combines a deep convolution generative
          adversarial network (DCGAN) with a support vector machine
          (SVM). The DCGAN is used as a sample generation and feature
          learning model, and the SVM is adopted as the classifier
          for predicting the label of a candidate at the inference
          stage. The proposed framework is a novel technique, which
          not only can solve the class imbalance problem but also can
          learn the discriminative feature representations of pulsar
          candidates instead of computing hand-crafted features in
          the pre-processing steps. The proposed method can enhance
          the accuracy of the APCI, and the computer experiments
          performed on two pulsar data sets verified the
          effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

          there are more moment restrictions than underlying

          galaxies remains challenging, the combination of

          one of the largest available samples of candidate RLAGN. We
          used the sample, combined with recently developed
          analytical models, to investigate the lifetime distribution

          probably the old tail of the general RLAGN population, but
          that the low-luminosity RLAGN candidates in our sample,
          many of which have sizes <100 kpc, either require a very
          diﬀerent lifetime distribution or have diﬀerent jet

          Measure Synthesis technique, first described by Burn
          (1966), and recently extended and implemented by Brentjens
          \& de Bruyn (2005). The method takes advantage of the
          excellent spectral coverage provided by modern radio
          telescopes to reconstruct the intrinsic polarization
          properties along a line of sight, using a Fourier
          relationship between the observed polarization products and
          a function describing the intrinsic polarization (the
          Faraday dispersion function). An important consequence of
          the Fourier relationship and discrete frequency sampling is
          the need, in some cases, to deconvolve the sampling
          response from the reconstructed Faraday dispersion
          function. Practical aspects of the deconvolution procedure
          are discussed. We illustrate the use of the technique by
          summarizing a recent investigation carried out with the
          WSRT. We conclude by briefly describing the applicability
          to future programs which will be carried out with the next
          generation of radio telescopes such as LOFAR.},

  abstract  = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary
          Universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology
          of the processes that link the formation and evolution of
          galaxies with their central supermassive black holes. We
          present a picture in which the population of active
          galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be divided into two distinct
          populations. The radiative-mode AGNs are associated with
          black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by
          accretion at rates in excess of \~{}1\% of the Eddington
          limit. They are primarily associated with less massive BHs
          growing in high-density pseudobulges at a rate sufficient
          to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in \~{}10
          Gyr. The circumnuclear environment contains high-density
          cold gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are
          not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward;
          secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is
          generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen
          only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk
          of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows
          (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs
          in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies.
          Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in
          their host bulge is significant today. These AGNs are
          probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas
          that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN
          radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint
          a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of
          star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant
          over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that
          linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still
          at play today.},

  abstract  = {The FIRST survey, begun over 20 years ago, provides the
          definitive high-resolution map of the radio sky. This Very
          Large Telescope (VLA) survey reaches a detection
          sensitivity of 1 mJy at 20 cm over a final footprint of
          10,575 deg2 that is largely coincident with the Sloan
          Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) area. Both the images and a
          catalog containing 946,432 sources are available through
          the FIRST Web site (http://sundog.stsci.edu). We record
          here the authoritative survey history, including hardware
          and software changes that affect the catalog's reliability
          and completeness. In particular, we use recent observations
          taken with the JVLA to test various aspects of the survey
          data (astrometry, CLEAN bias, and the flux density scale).
          We describe a new, sophisticated algorithm for flagging
          potential sidelobes in this snapshot survey, and show that
          fewer than 10\% of the cataloged objects are likely
          sidelobes, and that these are heavily concentrated at low
          flux densities and in the vicinity of bright sources, as
          expected. We also report a comparison of the survey with
          the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), as well as a match of the
          FIRST catalog to the SDSS and Two Micron Sky Survey (2MASS)
          sky surveys. The NVSS match shows very good consistency in
          flux density scale and astrometry between the two surveys.
          The matches with 2MASS and SDSS indicate a systematic
          \~{}10-20 mas astrometric error with respect to the optical
          reference frame in all VLA data that has disappeared with
          the advent of the JVLA. We demonstrate strikingly different
          behavior between the radio matches to stellar objects and
          to galaxies in the optical and IR surveys reflecting the
          different radio populations present over the flux density
          range 1-1000 mJy. As the radio flux density declines,
          stellar counterparts (quasars) get redder and fainter,
          while galaxies get brighter and have colors that initially
          redden but then turn bluer near the FIRST detection limit.
          Implications for future radio sky surveys are also briefly
          discussed. In particular, we show that for radio source
          identification at faint optical magnitudes, high angular
          resolution observations are essential, and cannot be
          sacrificed in exchange for high signal-to-noise data. The
          value of a JVLA survey as a complement to Square Kilometer
          Array precursor surveys is briefly discussed.},

          efficient, since they exploit the inherent
          translation-invariance of natural images. However,
          translation is just one of a myriad of useful spatial
          transformations. Can the same efficiency be attained when
          considering other spatial invariances? Such generalized
          convolutions have been considered in the past, but at a
          high computational cost. We present a construction that is
          simple and exact, yet has the same computational complexity
          that standard convolutions enjoy. It consists of a constant
          image warp followed by a simple convolution, which are
          standard blocks in deep learning toolboxes. With a
          carefully crafted warp, the resulting architecture can be
          made equivariant to a wide range of two-parameter spatial
          transformations. We show encouraging results in realistic
          scenarios, including the estimation of vehicle poses in the
          Google Earth dataset (rotation and scale), and face poses
          in Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (3D rotations
          under perspective).}

  abstract  = {For many supervised learning tasks it may be infeasible
          (or very expensive) to obtain objective and reliable
          labels. Instead, we can collect subjective (possibly noisy)
          labels from multiple experts or annotators. In practice,
          there is a substantial amount of disagreement among the
          annotators, and hence it is of great practical interest to
          address conventional supervised learning problems in this
          scenario. In this paper we describe a probabilistic
          approach for supervised learning when we have multiple
          annotators providing (possibly noisy) labels but no
          absolute gold standard. The proposed algorithm evaluates
          the different experts and also gives an estimate of the

          learning techniques},
  url       = {https://repository.nwu.ac.za/handle/10394/31250},
  abstract  = {Until now radio galaxies have primarily been classified
          using the human neural system. The Square Kilometre Array
          (SKA) will, however, produce a very large amount of science
          data, extending into the multiple-petabyte range. Therefore
          there is an urgent need to develop new, automated
          techniques to maximally exploit the SKA data. Machine
          Learning (ML) techniques are currently being used in
          several fields of Astrophysics and in this thesis we
          comprehensively explore ML as a way to distinguish point
          and extended sources (P-E) and to classify radio galaxies
          as belonging to Fanaroff-Riley class I or II (FRI-FRII).
          Our first step was to classify radio sources based on their
          morphology using filtering methods. We used images from the
          Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) and compared
          the following techniques: (i) the LULU operators and the
          Discrete Pulse Transform (DPT) algorithms with a low and
          high pass filtering. The LULU and DPT algorithms have only
          been successful in classifying extended sources and are
          computationally expensive. (ii) we then explored other
          techniques to extract the sources by applying a high pass
          filter to the radio images. Using Otsu thresholding and
          Gaussian filtering methods, we have been able to extract
          not only extended sources but also made gains in
          computational time. Our next approach has been to classify
          P-E and FRI-FRII sources using various ML algorithms. These
          included the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest
          (RF), k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) which
          require specific features of the radio images as inputs. We
          implemented shapelet analysis to decompose the radio images
          into their corresponding shapelet coefficients which are
          then fed into the ML algorithms. For P-E discrimination, a
          neural network was the most effective algorithm, with an
          accuracy of 89\% and area under curve (AUC) value of 93\%.
          For FRI-FRII sources, the RF algorithm proved to be the
          best with an accuracy of 75\% and AUC value of 74\%. The
          final stage of this thesis has been to apply deep learning
          to FRI-FRII source classification in the form of a
          Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For the first time in
          radio astronomy we have added a Generative Adversarial
          Neural (GAN) network to generate realistic looking data to
          supplement the real data during training. The result from
          the CNN+GAN algorithm has proved to be better than both the
          RF algorithm and the CNN alone with standard data
          augmentation (flipping and rotation), yielding an accuracy
          of 84\% and AUC value of 85\%, showing that combining GANs
          with convolutional networks for radio astronomy is likely
          to add significant value in the era of the SKA.},

          Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, and present the
          resulting extragalactic catalogue, utilizing the first year
          of observations. The catalogue covers 24 831 square
          degrees, over declinations south of +30{\textdegree} and
          Galactic latitudes outside 10{\textdegree} of the Galactic
          plane, excluding some areas such as the Magellanic Clouds.
          It contains 307 455 radio sources with 20 separate flux
          density measurements across 72-231 MHz, selected from a
          time- and frequency-integrated image centred at 200 MHz,
          with a resolution of ?2 arcmin. Over the catalogued region,
          we estimate that the catalogue is 90 per cent complete at
          170 mJy, and 50 per cent complete at 55 mJy, and large
          areas are complete at even lower flux density levels. Its
          reliability is 99.97 per cent above the detection threshold
          of 5$\sigma$, which itself is typically 50 mJy. These
          observations constitute the widest fractional bandwidth and
          largest sky area survey at radio frequencies to date, and
          calibrate the low-frequency flux density scale of the
          southern sky to better than 10 per cent. This paper
          presents details of the flagging, imaging, mosaicking and
          source extraction/characterization, as well as estimates of

          dynamics and energetics of a representative sample of
          Fanaroff–Riley type II (FR II) radio galaxies with
          well-characterized group/cluster environments. We used
          X-ray inverse-Compton and radio synchrotron measurements to
          determine the internal radio-lobe conditions, and these
          were compared with external pressures acting on the lobes,
          determined from measurements of the thermal X-ray emission
          of the group/cluster. Consistent with previous work, we
          found that FR II radio lobes are typically electron
          dominated by a small factor relative to equipartition, and
          are overpressured relative to the external medium in their
          outer parts. These results suggest that there is typically
          no energetically significant proton population in the lobes
          of FR II radio galaxies (unlike for FR Is), and so for this
          population, inverse-Compton modelling provides an accurate
          way of measuring total energy content and estimating jet
          power. We estimated the distribution of Mach numbers for
          the population of expanding radio lobes, finding that at
          least half of the radio galaxies are currently driving
          strong shocks into their group/cluster environments.
          Finally, we determined a jet power–radio luminosity
          relation for FR II radio galaxies based on our estimates of
          lobe internal energy and Mach number. The slope and
          normalization of this relation are consistent with
          theoretical expectations, given the departure from
          equipartition and environmental distribution for our

          3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and NGC 4594. Indirect arguments
          suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black
          holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This
          paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness
          of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical
          evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical
          evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas
          measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and
          in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A
          statistical survey finds BHs in \${\textbackslash}sim
          20{\textbackslash}\%\$ of nearby E--Sbc galaxies,
          consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH
          masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component.
          Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance
          of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation.
          Flashes caused by the accretion of individual stars may
          provide a test of the BH picture.},

  abstract  = {The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) is a synoptic,
          all-sky radio sky survey with a unique combination of high
          angular resolution (?2"5), sensitivity (a 1$\sigma$ goal of
          70 $\mu$Jy/beam in the coadded data), full linear Stokes
          polarimetry, time domain coverage, and wide bandwidth
          (2{\textendash}4 GHz). The first observations began in 2017
          September, and observing for the survey will finish in
          2024. VLASS will use approximately 5500 hr of time on the
          Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to cover the whole
          sky visible to the VLA (decl. {\textgreater}
          -40{\textdegree}), a total of 33 885 deg
          \$\{\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ 2 . The data will be taken
          in three epochs to allow the discovery of variable and
          transient radio sources. The survey is designed to engage
          radio astronomy experts, multi-wavelength astronomers, and
          citizen scientists alike. By utilizing an "on the fly"
          interferometry mode, the observing overheads are much
          reduced compared to a conventional pointed survey. In this
          paper, we present the science case and observational
          strategy for the survey, and also results from early survey
          observations.},

  abstract  = {We have observed 37 bright, polarized radio sources with
          the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) to present a novel analysis
          of their Faraday rotation properties. Each source was
          observed during the commissioning phase with two to four
          100 MHz bands at frequencies ranging from 1 to 2 GHz. These
          observations demonstrate how the continuous frequency
          coverage of the ATA's log-periodic receiver can be applied
          to the study of Faraday rotation measures (RMs). We use RM
          synthesis to show that wide-bandwidth data can find
          multiple RM components toward a single source. Roughly a
          quarter of the sources studied have extra RM components
          with high confidence (brighter than ?40 mJy), when
          observing with an RM resolution of roughly 100 rad m-2.
          These extra components contribute 10\%-70\% of the total
          polarized flux. This is the first time multiple RM
          components have been identified in a large sample of point
          sources. For our observing configuration, these extra RM
          components bias the measurement of the peak RM by 10-15 rad
          m-2 more generally, the peak RM cannot be determined more
          precisely than the RM beam size. Comparing our 1-2 GHz RM
          spectra to Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) polarimetric
          maps shows that both techniques can identify complicated
          Faraday structures in the sources. However, the RM values
          and fractional polarization are generally smaller at lower
          frequencies than in the higher frequency VLBA maps. With a
          few exceptions, the RMs from this work are consistent with
          that of earlier, narrow-bandwidth, all-sky surveys. This
          work also describes the polarimetry calibration procedure
          and that on-axis ATA observations of linear polarization
          can be calibrated to an accuracy of 0.2\% of Stokes I.
          Future research directions include studying the
          time-dependent RM structure in active galactic nuclei and
          enabling accurate, wide-area RM surveys to test models of
          Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields.},

          magnetic-field structures in the faint regions of the
          sources; and to investigate the contribution of the
          Galactic foreground to the observed RM structures. The
          magnetic field lines follow the contours of total intensity
          and are either parallel or perpendicular to ridge lines.
          This behavior can be explained by a model in which the
          field is aligned by the shear and compression of a
          supersonic jet excavating a cavity in a much denser medium.
          There tend to be larger variations in RM in the most
          luminous sources. At high Galactic latitudes the RM
          structure is on scales comparable with the beam (typically
          5 arcsec). RM variations are usually larger on the brighter

  abstract  = {From a statistically complete sample of 188 radio galaxies
          in Abell clusters, we examine the radio/optical
          correlations, the FR I/II division, and the univariate and
          bivariate luminosity functions. As suggested by Owen [Jets
          in Extragalactic Radio Sources, edited by H.-J. Roser and
          K. Meisenheimer (Springer, New York, 1993), p. 273], the FR
          I/II division is shown to be a strong function of the
          optical luminosity of the host galaxy ( is proportional to
          L{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum}\_opt\_). This
          dependence is also seen in the bivariate luminosity
          function, which suggests that the evolutionary tracks of
          radio sources and/or the initial conditions in the source
          are governed by the host galaxy properties. The probability
          for detecting radio emission increases with optical
          luminosity. The optical dependence is clearly separated in
          the integral luminosity functions which can be used as a
          constraint to models of FR I radio power evolution.
          Additionally, the source counts from the integrated
          univariate radio luminosity function (RLF) are consistent
          with our suggestion in Paper V that radio sources may be a
          transient phenomenon which occurs in all elliptical
          galaxies at some time (or several times) over their
          lifetime. We find no statistically significant differences
          in the luminosity functions between rich cluster samples
          and radio sources not selected to reside in clusters. These
          results suggest that all radio galaxies live in similar
          environments in that the optical luminosity and the
          properties of the host galaxy are the most important
          parameters which affect radio source formation and evolution.},

  abstract  = {Signal classification is an important issue in many
          branches of science and engineering. In signal
          classification, a feature of the signals is often selected
          for similarity comparison. A distance metric must then be
          established to measure the dissimilarities between
          different signal features. Due to the natural
          characteristics of dynamic systems, the power spectral
          density (PSD) of a signal is often used as a feature to
          facilitate classification. We reason in this paper that PSD
          matrices have structural constraints and that they describe
          a manifold in the signal space. Thus, instead of the widely
          used Euclidean distance (ED), a more appropriate measure is
          the Riemannian distance (RD) on the manifold. Here, we
          develop closed-form expressions of the RD between two PSD
          matrices on the manifold and study some of the properties.
          We further show how an optimum weighting matrix can be
          developed for the application of RD to signal
          classification. These new distance measures are then
          applied to the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)
          signals for the determination of sleep states and the
          results are highly encouraging.},

  abstract  = {Pulsar candidate sifting is an essential process for
          discovering new pulsars. It aims to search for the most
          promising pulsar candidates from an all-sky survey, such as
          the High Time Resolution Universe (HTRU), Green Bank
          Northern Celestial Cap (GBNCC), Five-hundred-meter Aperture
          Spherical Radio Telescope, etc. Recently, machine learning
          (ML) has become a hot topic in investigations of pulsar
          candidate sifting. However, one typical challenge in ML for
          pulsar candidate sifting comes from the learning difficulty
          arising from the high class imbalance between the observed
          numbers of pulsars and non-pulsars. Therefore, this work
          proposes a novel framework for candidate sifting, named
          Multi-input Convolutional Neural Networks (MICNN). MICNN is
          an architecture of deep learning with four diagnostic plots
          of a pulsar candidate as its inputs. To train our MICNN on
          a highly class-imbalanced data set, a novel image
          augmentation technique is proposed, as well as a
          three-stage training strategy. Experiments on observations
          from HTRU and GBNCC show the effectiveness and robustness
          of these proposed techniques. In the experiments on HTRU,
          our MICNN model achieves a recall rate of 0.962 and a
          precision rate of 0.967 even in a highly class-imbalanced
          test data set.},

          and merger history. It is strongly correlated with many
          physical parameters, including mass, star formation history
          and the distribution of mass. The Galaxy Zoo project
          collected simple morphological classifications of nearly
          900 000 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
          contributed by hundreds of thousands of volunteers. This

          biases inherent in morphological classification. This paper
          presents the data collected by the project, alongside
          measures of classification accuracy and bias. The data are

  abstract  = {Finding and classifying astronomical sources is key in the
          scientific exploitation of radio surveys. Source-finding
          usually involves identifying the parts of an image
          belonging to an astronomical source, against some estimated
          background. This can be problematic in the radio regime,
          owing to the presence of correlated noise, which can
          interfere with the signal from the source. In the current
          work, we present ConvoSource, a novel method based on a
          deep learning technique, to identify the positions of radio
          sources, and compare the results to a Gaussian-fitting
          method. Since the deep learning approach allows the
          generation of more training images, it should perform well
          in the source-finding task. We test the source-finding
          methods on artificial data created for the data challenge
          of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We investigate sources
          that are divided into three classes: star forming galaxies
          (SFGs) and two classes of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The
          artificial data are given at two different frequencies (560
          MHz and 1400 MHz), three total integration times (8 h, 100
          h, 1000 h), and three signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 1,
          2, and 5. At lower SNRs, ConvoSource tends to outperform a
          Gaussian-fitting approach in the recovery of SFGs and all
          sources, although at the lowest SNR of one, the better
          performance is likely due to chance matches. The
          Gaussian-fitting method performs better in the recovery of
          the AGN-type sources at lower SNRs. At a higher SNR,
          ConvoSource performs better on average in the recovery of
          AGN sources, whereas the Gaussian-fitting method performs
          better in the recovery of SFGs and all sources. ConvoSource
          usually performs better at shorter total integration times
          and detects more true positives and misses fewer sources
          compared to the Gaussian-fitting method; however, it
          detects more false positives.},

  abstract  = {Next-generation radio surveys will yield an unprecedented
          amount of data, warranting analysis by use of machine
          learning techniques. Convolutional neural networks are the
          deep learning technique that has proven to be the most
          successful in classifying image data. Capsule networks are
          a more recently developed technique that use capsules
          comprised of groups of neurons that describe properties of
          an image including the relative spatial locations of
          features. This work explores the performance of different
          capsule network architectures against simpler convolutional
          neural network architectures, in reproducing the
          classifications into the classes of unresolved, FRI, and
          FRII morphologies. We utilize images from a LOFAR survey
          which is the deepest, wide-area radio survey to date,
          revealing more complex radio-source structures compared to
          previous surveys, presenting further challenges for machine
          learning algorithms. The four- and eight-layer
          convolutional networks attain an average precision of 93.3
          per cent and 94.3 per cent, respectively, compared to 89.7
          per cent obtained with the capsule network, when training
          on original and augmented images. Implementing transfer
          learning achieves a precision of 94.4 per cent, which is
          within the confidence interval of the eight-layer
          convolutional network. The convolutional networks always
          outperform any variation of the capsule network, as they
          prove to be more robust to the presence of noise in images.
          The use of pooling appears to allow more freedom for the
          intra-class variability of radio galaxy morphologies, as
          well as reducing the impact of noise.},

          central active galactic nuclei (AGN), which is studied to
          reveal the evolution of the super massive black hole

          the DNNAE are symmetric aside a fully-connected layer

          randomly generating the feature vectors later with a

          distributions introduce systematic uncertainties that
          affect observable-mass relations and selection functions of
          galaxy groups and clusters. However, the triaxial gas
          distributions depend on the non-linear physical processes
          of halo formation histories and baryonic physics, which are
          challenging to model accurately. In this study we explore a
          machine learning approach for modelling the dependence of
          gas shapes on dark matter and baryonic properties. With
          data from the Illustris-TNG hydrodynamical cosmological
          simulations, we develop a machine learning pipeline that
          applies XGBoost, an implementation of gradient boosted
          decision trees, to predict radial profiles of gas shapes
          from halo properties. We show that XGBoost models can
          accurately predict gas shape profiles in dark matter
          haloes. We also explore model interpretability with SHAP, a
          method that identifies the most predictive properties at
          different halo radii. We find that baryonic properties best
          predict gas shapes in halo cores, whereas dark matter
          shapes are the main predictors in the halo outskirts. This
          work demonstrates the power of interpretable machine
          learning in modelling observable properties of dark matter

          observations (C2340) to complete the sample of giant radio
          galaxies described below. One of the key challenges today
          is to account for nearly half of the baryons in the
          present-day universe that are missing. These missing
          baryons are thought to pervade the moderate overdensity
          filaments (with fractional overdensity {\textasciitilde}10
          to 100) of the large-scale structure as a Warm-Hot
          intergalactic medium (WHIM) of 10{\textasciicircum}5 to
          10{\textasciicircum}7 K gas. The state of the gas is a
          consequence of the hydrodynamic infall heating and, more
          importantly, the astrophysical feedback on the environment
          from galaxy formation and evolution. We propose to use a
          sample of giant radio galaxies embedded in the filaments,
          with radio jets that interact with the gas beyond and
          outside of their host galaxy, as a probe of the WHIM.
          Modelling the jet-WHIM interaction and the evolution of the
          radio synchrotron plasma lobes in the gas and gravitational
          field of the surrounding large-scale structure constitutes
          a novel method of constraining the physical parameters and
          cosmological evolution of the WHIM gas, and thereby
          assessing the importance of feedback from galaxy evolution
          on the state of this gas.},

  abstract  = {The dominant source of radio emission from quasars has
          been debated for decades. We present the radio luminosity
          function (RLF) of optically-selected quasars below 1 mJy,
          constructed by applying a Bayesian-fitting stacking
          technique to objects below the nominal radio flux-density
          limit. We test the technique using simulated data,
          confirming that we can reconstruct the RLF over three
          orders of magnitude below the typical 5$\sigma$ threshold,
          although this is dependent on the number density of the
          population in question. We apply our method to 1.4-GHz
          flux-densities from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at
          Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey, extracted at the positions of
          optical quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS
          DR7) over seven redshift bins. The lowest redshift bin (0.2
          {\textless} z {\textless} 0.45) constitutes a
          volume-limited sampled defined by Mi {\textless} -23 and we
          measure the optically-selected quasar RLF over two orders
          of magnitude below the FIRST detection threshold of 1 mJy.
          We find that our measured RLF is in agreement with deeper
          data from the literature. We find that the radio luminosity
          function for the radio-loud quasars flattens around
          log10[L1.4/W Hz-1] ? 25, where radio-quiet quasars start to
          emerge. The radio luminosity were radio-quiet quasars
          emerge coincides with the luminosity where star-forming
          galaxies start to dominate the radio source counts. This
          implies that there could be a significant contribution from
          star formation in the host galaxies, but additional data is
          required to investigate this further. The higher-redshift
          bins show similar behaviour (i.e. RLF shape) as for the
          lowest-z bin, at least up to z = 2.15, implying that the
          same physical process may be responsible.},

          via unsupervised machine learning},
  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10537},
  abstract  = {Galaxy morphology is a fundamental quantity, that is
          essential not only for the full spectrum of
          galaxy-evolution studies, but also for a plethora of
          science in observational cosmology. While a rich literature
          exists on morphological-classification techniques, the
          unprecedented data volumes, coupled, in some cases, with
          the short cadences of forthcoming 'Big-Data' surveys (e.g.
          from the LSST), present novel challenges for this field.
          Large data volumes make such datasets intractable for
          visual inspection (even via massively-distributed platforms
          like Galaxy Zoo), while short cadences make it difficult to
          employ techniques like supervised machine-learning, since
          it may be impractical to repeatedly produce training sets
          on short timescales. Unsupervised machine learning, which
          does not require training sets, is ideally suited to the
          morphological analysis of new and forthcoming surveys.
          Here, we employ an algorithm that performs clustering of
          graph representations, in order to group image patches with
          similar visual properties and objects constructed from
          those patches, like galaxies. We implement the algorithm on
          the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru-Strategic-Program Ultra-Deep
          survey, to autonomously reduce the galaxy population to a
          small number (160) of 'morphological clusters', populated
          by galaxies with similar morphologies, which are then
          benchmarked using visual inspection. The morphological
          classifications (which we release publicly) exhibit a high
          level of purity, and reproduce known trends in key galaxy
          properties as a function of morphological type at
          z{\textless}1 (e.g. stellar-mass functions, rest-frame
          colours and the position of galaxies on the star-formation
          main sequence). Our study demonstrates the power of
          unsupervised machine learning in performing accurate
          morphological analysis, which will become indispensable in
          this new era of deep-wide surveys.},

  abstract  = {The Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) is the first
          large-area survey to be conducted with the full 36-antenna
          Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)
          telescope. RACS will provide a shallow model of the ASKAP
          sky that will aid the calibration of future deep ASKAP
          surveys. RACS will cover the whole sky visible from the
          ASKAP site in Western Australia and will cover the full
          ASKAP band of 700-1800 MHz. The RACS images are generally
          deeper than the existing NRAO VLA Sky Survey and Sydney
          University Molonglo Sky Survey radio surveys and have
          better spatial resolution. All RACS survey products will be
          public, including radio images (with \$\~{}\$ 15 arcsec
          resolution) and catalogues of about three million source
          components with spectral index and polarisation
          information. In this paper, we present a description of the
          RACS survey and the first data release of 903 images
          covering the sky south of declination
          \$+41{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ made over a
          288-MHz band centred at 887.5 MHz.},

          of Razin-Tsytovich suppression has no significant effect on
          the degree of circular polarization. (2) The onset of
          self-absorption in a source subject to weak Faraday
          rotation (negligible Faraday rotation in an absorption
          length) causes the degree of circular polarization to
          reverse its sign and to decrease (by between one half and
          one quarter for typical parameters) in magnitude. (3) As in
          (2) but for strong Faraday rotation (many rotations of the
          plane of polarization in an absorption length) the degree
          of circular polarization also reverses its sign and becomes

  abstract  = {QU-fitting is a standard model-fitting method to
          reconstruct distribution of magnetic fields and polarized
          intensity along a line of sight (LOS) from an observed
          polarization spectrum. In this paper, we examine the
          performance of QU-fitting by simulating observations of two
          polarized sources located along the same LOS, varying the
          widths of the sources and the gap between them in Faraday
          depth space, systematically. Markov Chain Monte Carlo
          (MCMC) approach is used to obtain the best-fit parameters
          for a fitting model, and Akaike and Bayesian Information
          Criteria (AIC and BIC, respectively) are adopted to select
          the best model from four fitting models. We find that the
          combination of MCMC and AIC/BIC works fairly well in model
          selection and estimation of model parameters in the cases
          where two sources have relatively small widths and a larger
          gap in Faraday depth space. On the other hand, when two
          sources have large width in Faraday depth space, MCMC chain
          tends to be trapped in a local maximum so that AIC/BIC
          cannot select a correct model. We discuss the causes and
          the tendency of the failure of QU-fitting and suggest a way
          to improve it.},

          (LoTSS) is a low-frequency radio continuum survey of the
          Northern sky at an unparalleled resolution and sensitivity.
          In order to fully exploit this huge dataset and those
          produced by the Square Kilometre Array in the next decade,
          automated methods in machine learning and data-mining will
          be increasingly essential both for morphological
          classifications and for identifying optical counterparts to
          the radio sources. Using self-organising maps (SOMs), a
          form of unsupervised machine learning, we created a
          dimensionality reduction of the radio morphologies for the
          \${\textbackslash}sim\$25k extended radio continuum sources
          in the LoTSS first data release, which is only
          \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 percent of the final LoTSS survey.
          We made use of {\textbackslash}textsc\{PINK\}, a code which
          extends the SOM algorithm with rotation and flipping
          invariance, increasing its suitability and effectiveness
          for training on astronomical sources. After training, the
          SOMs can be used for a wide range of science exploitation
          and we present an illustration of their potential by
          finding an arbitrary number of morphologically rare sources
          in our training data (424 square degrees) and subsequently
          in an area of the sky (\${\textbackslash}sim\$5300 square
          degrees) outside the training data. Objects found in this
          way span a wide range of morphological and physical
          categories: extended jets of radio active galactic nuclei,
          diffuse cluster haloes and relics, and nearby spiral
          galaxies. Finally, to enable accessible, interactive, and
          intuitive data exploration, we showcase the LOFAR-PyBDSF

          dataset through the trained SOMs.},

          simulations of interaction of active galactic nucleus jets
          with a dense turbulent two-phase interstellar medium, which
          would be typical of high-redshift galaxies. We describe the
          effect of the jet on the evolution of the density of the
          turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). The jet-driven energy
          bubble affects the gas to distances up to several
          kiloparsecs from the injection region. The shocks resulting
          from such interactions create a multiphase ISM and radial
          outflows. One of the striking result of this work is that
          low-power jets (Pjet ? 1043 ergs-1), although less
          efficient in accelerating clouds, are trapped in the ISM
          for a longer time and hence affect the ISM over a larger
          volume. Jets of higher power drill through with relative
          ease. Although the relativistic jets launch strong
          outflows, there is little net mass ejection to very large
          distances, supporting a galactic fountain scenario for
          local feedback.},

          performed a suite of simulations with different mean

          (A) The relativistic jet couples strongly with the gas in
          the inner kpc, creating a cavity and launching outflows.
          (B) The high pressure bubble inflated by the jet and its
          back-flow compresses the disc at the outer edges, driving
          inflows within the disc. (C) Jets inclined towards the disc
          affect the disc more and launch sub-relativistic,
          wide-angled outflows along the minor axis. (D) Shocks
          driven directly by the jet and the jet-driven energy bubble
          raise the velocity dispersion throughout the disc by
          several times its initial value. (E) Compression by the
          jet-driven shocks can enhance the star formation rate in
          the disc, especially in a ring-like geometry close to the
          axis. However, enhanced turbulent dispersion in the disc
          also leads to quenching of star formation. Whether positive
          or negative feedback dominates depends on jet power, ISM
          density, jet orientation with respect to the disc, and the

  abstractnote  = {We present DASH (Deep Automated Supernova and Host
          classifier), a novel software package that automates the
          classification of the type, age, redshift, and host galaxy
          of supernova spectra. DASH makes use of a new approach that
          does not rely on iterative template-matching techniques
          like all previous software, but instead classifies based on
          the learned features of each supernova’s type and age. It
          has achieved this by employing a deep convolutional neural
          network to train a matching algorithm. This approach has
          enabled DASH to be orders of magnitude faster than previous
          tools, being able to accurately classify hundreds or
          thousands of objects within seconds. We have tested its
          performance on 4 yr of data from the Australian Dark Energy
          Survey (OzDES). The deep learning models were developed
          using TensorFlow and were trained using over 4000 supernova
          spectra taken from the CfA Supernova Program and the
          Berkeley SN Ia Program as used in SNID (Supernova
          Identification software). Unlike template-matching methods,
          the trained models are independent of the number of spectra
          in the training data, which allows for DASH’s
          unprecedented speed. We have developed both a graphical
          interface for easy visual classification and analysis of
          supernovae and a Python library for the autonomous and
          quick classification of several supernova spectra. The
          speed, accuracy, user-friendliness, and versatility of DASH
          present an advancement to existing spectral classification
          tools. We have made the code publicly available on GitHub
          and PyPI (pip install astrodash) to allow for further
          contributions and development. The package documentation is

  title     = {A scaled {Bregman} theorem with applications},
  abstract  = {Bregman divergences play a central role in the design and
          analysis of a range of machine learning algorithms through
          a handful of popular theorems. We present a new theorem
          which shows that {\textquotedblleft}Bregman
          distortions{\textquotedblright} (employing a potentially
          non-convex generator) may be exactly re-written as a scaled
          Bregman divergence computed over transformed data. This
          property can be viewed from the standpoints of geometry (a
          scaled isometry with adaptive metrics) or convex
          optimization (relating generalized perspective transforms).
          Admissible distortions include geodesic distances on curved
          manifolds and projections or gauge-normalisation. Our
          theorem allows one to leverage to the wealth and
          convenience of Bregman divergences when analysing
          algorithms relying on the aforementioned Bregman
          distortions. We illustrate this with three novel
          applications of our theorem: a reduction from multi-class
          density ratio to class-probability estimation, a new
          adaptive projection free yet norm-enforcing dual norm
          mirror descent algorithm, and a reduction from clustering
          on flat manifolds to clustering on curved manifolds.
          Experiments on each of these domains validate the analyses
          and suggest that the scaled Bregman theorem might be a
          worthy addition to the popular handful of Bregman
          divergence properties that have been pervasive in machine
          learning.},

  abstract  = {Future radio surveys will generate catalogs of tens of
          millions of radio sources, for which redshift estimates
          will be essential to achieve many of the science goals.
          However, spectroscopic data will be available for only a
          small fraction of these sources, and in most cases even the
          optical and infrared photometry will be of limited quality.
          Furthermore, radio sources tend to be at higher redshift
          than most optical sources (most radio surveys have a median
          redshift greater than 1) and so a significant fraction of
          radio sources hosts differ from those for which most
          photometric redshift templates are designed. We therefore
          need to develop new techniques for estimating the redshifts
          of radio sources. As a starting point in this process, we
          evaluate a number of machine-learning techniques for
          estimating redshift, together with a conventional
          template-fitting technique. We pay special attention to how
          the performance is affected by the incompleteness of the
          training sample and by sparseness of the parameter space or
          by limited availability of ancillary multiwavelength data.
          As expected, we find that the quality of the
          photometric-redshift degrades as the quality of the
          photometry decreases, but that even with the limited
          quality of photometry available for all-sky-surveys, useful
          redshift information is available for the majority of
          sources, particularly at low redshift. We find that a
          template-fitting technique performs best in the presence of
          high-quality and almost complete multi-band photometry,
          especially if radio sources that are also X-ray emitting
          are treated separately, using specific templates and
          priors. When we reduced the quality of photometry to match
          that available for the EMU all-sky radio survey, the
          quality of the template-fitting degraded and became
          comparable to some of the machine-learning methods. Machine
          learning techniques currently perform better at low
          redshift than at high redshift, because of incompleteness
          of the currently available training data at high
          redshifts.},

          the quasar PKS B2126-158 (z = 3.268) from 1 to 10 GHz using
          the Australia Telescope Compact Array. The source has large
          fractional circular polarization (CP), mc =
          {\textbar}V{\textbar}/I, detected at high significance
          across the entire band (from 15 to 90$\sigma$ per 128 MHz
          subband). This allows us to construct the most robust CP
          spectrum of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet to date.
          We find mc ? $\nu$+0.60 {\textpm} 0.03 from 1.5 to 6.5 GHz,
          with a peak of mc \~{} 1 per cent before the spectrum turns
          over somewhere between 6.5 and 8 GHz, above which mc ?
          $\nu$-3.0 {\textpm} 0.4. The fractional linear polarization
          (LP; p) varies from 0.2 to \~{}1 per cent across our
          frequency range and is strongly anticorrelated with the
          fractional CP, with a best-fitting power law giving mc ?
          p-0.24 {\textpm} 0.03. This is the first clear relation
          between the observed LP and CP of an AGN jet, revealing the
          action of Faraday conversion of LP to CP within the jet.
          More detailed modelling in conjunction with high spatial
          resolution observations are required to determine the true
          driving force behind the conversion (i.e. magnetic twist or
          internal Faraday rotation). In particular determining
          whether the observed Faraday rotation is internal or
          entirely external to the jet is key to this goal. The
          simplest interpretation of our observations favours some
          internal Faraday rotation, implying that Faraday
          rotation-driven conversion of LP to CP is the dominant CP
          generation mechanism. In this case, a small amount of
          vector-ordered magnetic field along the jet axis is
          required, along with internal Faraday rotation from the
          low-energy end of the relativistic electron energy spectrum
          in an electron{\textendash}proton-dominated jet.},

          polarized at 1.4 GHz. We use a general-purpose,
          polarization model-fitting procedure that describes the
          Faraday rotation measure (RM) and intrinsic polarization
          structure of up to three distinct polarized emission
          regions or `RM components' of a source. Overall, 37 per
          cent/52 per cent/11 per cent of sources are best fitted by
          one/two/three RM components. However, these fractions are
          dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in
          polarization (more RM components more likely at higher
          S/N). In general, our analysis shows that sources with high
          integrated degrees of polarization at 1.4 GHz have low
          Faraday depolarization, are typically dominated by a single
          RM component, have a steep spectral index and have a high

          spectro-polarimetry study of the integrated emission from
          100 extragalactic radio sources with the Australia
          Telescope Compact Array, selected to be highly linearly
          polarized at 1.4 GHz. We use a general-purpose,
          polarization model-fitting procedure that describes the
          Faraday rotation measure (RM) and intrinsic polarization
          structure of up to three distinct polarized emission
          regions or `RM components' of a source. Overall, 37 per
          cent/52 per cent/11 per cent of sources are best fitted by
          one/two/three RM components. However, these fractions are
          dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in
          polarization (more RM components more likely at higher
          S/N). In general, our analysis shows that sources with high
          integrated degrees of polarization at 1.4 GHz have low
          Faraday depolarization, are typically dominated by a single
          RM component, have a steep spectral index and have a high
          intrinsic degree of polarization. After classifying our
          sample into radiative-mode and jet-mode AGN, we find no
          significant difference between the Faraday rotation or
          Faraday depolarization properties of jet-mode and
          radiative-mode AGN. However, there is a statistically
          significant difference in the intrinsic degree of
          polarization between the two types, with the jet-mode
          sources having more intrinsically ordered magnetic field
          structures than the radiative-mode sources. We also find a
          preferred perpendicular orientation of the intrinsic
          magnetic field structure of jet-mode AGN with respect to
          the jet direction, while no clear preference is found for

          of four bright ({\textgreater}1 Jy), strongly polarized,
          unresolved radio-loud quasars. The Australia Telescope
          Compact Array (ATCA) was used to observe these sources with
          2 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth from 1.1 to 3.1 GHz. This
          allowed us to spectrally resolve the polarization structure
          of spatially unresolved radio sources, and by fitting
          various Faraday rotation models to the data, we
          conclusively demonstrate that two of the sources cannot be
          described by a simple rotation measure (RM) component
          modified by depolarization from a foreground Faraday
          screen. Our results have important implications for using
          background extragalactic radio sources as probes of the
          Galactic and intergalactic magneto-ionic media as we show
          how RM estimations from narrow-bandwidth observations can
          give erroneous results in the presence of multiple
          interfering Faraday components. We postulate that the
          additional RM components arise from polarized structure in
          the compact inner regions of the radio source itself and
          not from polarized emission from galactic or intergalactic
          foreground regions. We further suggest that this may
          contribute significantly to any RM time variability seen in
          RM studies on these angular scales. Follow-up,
          high-sensitivity very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
          observations of these sources will directly test our

          giving useful estimates of their predictive
          \{{\textbackslash}em uncertainty\}. Quantifying uncertainty
          is especially critical in real-world settings, which often
          involve input distributions that are shifted from the
          training distribution due to a variety of factors including
          sample bias and non-stationarity. In such settings, well
          calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about
          when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted.
          Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including
          Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in
          the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but
          to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous

          mining algorithms is that the training and future data must
          be in the same feature space and have the same
          distribution. However, in many real-world applications,
          this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes
          have a classification task in one domain of interest, but
          we only have sufficient training data in another domain of
          interest, where the latter data may be in a different

          across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The fraction of
          the bolometric emission in the radio spans a factor of
          approximately 105 across the different classes of AGNs. The

          the absence of luminous jets allows us to probe radio
          emission from a wide range of possible mechanisms: star

          space can be used for highly successful morphology
          classification of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
          In this space, galaxies form well-separated early- and
          late-type branches. The location of galaxies along the
          branches reflects the degree and locality of star formation
          activity, and monotonically corresponds to the sequence of
          morphological subclasses. When the concentration index is
          also used, the completeness and reliability of
          classification reaches about 91\% for a training set of
          SDSS galaxies brighter than
          r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}pet{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}15.9.
          At the faintest magnitudes
          (r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}pet{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}17.5)
          of the SDSS spectroscopic sample, the accuracy still
          remains at about 88\%. The new classification scheme will
          help us find accurate relations of galaxy morphology with
          spatial and temporal environments, and help us to
          understand the origin of morphology of galaxies.},

          techniques to the problem of identifying giant radio
          sources (GRSs) from the data in the NVSS catalog are
          presented, and issues affecting the process are explored.
          Decision-tree pattern-recognition software was applied to
          training-set source pairs developed from known NVSS
          large-angular-size radio galaxies. The full training set
          consisted of 51,195 source pairs, 48 of which were known
          GRSs for which each lobe was primarily represented by a
          single catalog component. The source pairs had a maximum
          separation of 20{\textbackslash}prime and a minimum
          component area of 1.87 square arcmin at the 1.4 mJy level.
          The importance of comparing the resulting probability
          distributions of the training and application sets for
          cases of unknown class ratio is demonstrated. The
          probability of correctly ranking a randomly selected (GRS,
          non-GRS) pair from the best of the tested classifiers was
          determined to be 97.8 {\textpm} 1.5\%. The best classifiers
          were applied to the over 870,000 candidate pairs from the
          entire catalog. Images of higher-ranked sources were
          visually screened, and a table of over 1600 candidates,
          including morphological annotation, is presented. These
          systems include doubles and triples, wide-angle tail and
          narrow-angle tail, S- or Z-shaped systems, and core-jets
          and resolved cores. While some resolved-lobe systems are
          recovered with this technique, generally it is expected
          that such systems would require a different approach.},

  abstract  = {At the faintest radio flux densities (S1.4 {\textless} 10
          mJy), conflicting results have arisen regarding whether
          there is a flattening of the average spectral index between
          a low radio frequency (325 or 610 MHz), and e.g. 1.4 GHz.
          We present a new catalogue of 843 MHz radio sources in the
          ELAIS-S1 field that contains the sources, their ATLAS
          counterparts, and the spectral index distributions of the
          sources as a function of flux density. We do not find any
          statistically significant evidence for a trend towards
          flatter spectral indices with decreasing flux density. We
          then investigate the spectral index distribution with

  abstract  = {At the faintest radio flux densities (S1.4 {\textless} 10
          mJy), conflicting results have arisen regarding whether
          there is a flattening of the average spectral index between
          a low radio frequency (325 or 610 MHz), and e.g. 1.4 GHz.
          We present a new catalogue of 843 MHz radio sources in the
          ELAIS-S1 field that contains the sources, their ATLAS
          counterparts, and the spectral index distributions of the
          sources as a function of flux density. We do not find any
          statistically significant evidence for a trend towards
          flatter spectral indices with decreasing flux density. We
          then investigate the spectral index distribution with
          redshift for those sources with reliable redshifts and
          explore the infrared properties. An initial sample of faint

  abstract  = {For many supervised learning tasks it may be infeasible
          (or very expensive) to obtain objective and reliable
          labels. Instead, we can collect subjective (possibly noisy)
          labels from multiple experts or annotators. In practice,
          there is a substantial amount of disagreement among the
          annotators, and hence it is of great practical interest to
          address conventional supervised learning problems in this
          scenario. In this paper we describe a probabilistic
          approach for supervised learning when we have multiple
          annotators providing (possibly noisy) labels but no
          absolute gold standard. The proposed algorithm evaluates
          the different experts and also gives an estimate of the
          actual hidden labels. Experimental results indicate that
          the proposed method is superior to the commonly used
          majority voting baseline.},

          polarization of radio sources in the GOODS-N field at 1.4
          GHz at resolutions of 1.6 and 10 . At 1.6, we find that the
          peak flux cumulative number count distribution is N
          ({\textgreater}p) \~{} 45*(p/30 $\mu$Jy)-0.6 per square
          degree above a detection threshold of 14.5 $\mu$Jy. This
          represents a break from the steeper slopes at higher flux
          densities, resulting in fewer sources predicted for future
          surveys with the Square Kilometer Array and its precursors.
          It provides a significant challenge for using background
          rotation measures (RMs) to study clusters of galaxies or
          individual galaxies. Most of the polarized sources are well
          above our detection limit, and they are also radio galaxies
          that are well-resolved even at 10 , with redshifts from
          \~{}0.2{\textendash}1.9. We determined a total polarized
          flux for each source by integrating the 10 polarized
          intensity maps, as will be done by upcoming surveys such as
          POSSUM. These total polarized fluxes are a factor of two
          higher, on average, than the peak polarized flux at 1.6;
          this would increase the number counts by \~{}50\% at a
          fixed flux level. The detected sources have RMs with a
          characteristic rms scatter of \~{}11 rad m-2 around the
          local Galactic value, after eliminating likely outliers.
          The median fractional polarization from all total intensity
          sources does not continue the trend of increasing at lower
          flux densities, as seen for stronger sources. The changes
          in the polarization characteristics seen at these low
          fluxes likely represent the increasing dominance of
          star-forming galaxies.},

          radiative processes in astrophysics is designed to present
          - from a physicist's viewpoint - radiation processes and
          their applications to astrophysical phenomena and space
          science. The book covers such topics as radiative transfer
          theory, relativistic covariance and kinematics,
          bremsstrahlung radiation, Compton scattering, some plasma
          effects, and radiative transitions in atoms. The discussion
          begins with first principles, physically motivating and
          deriving all results rather than merely presenting finished
          formulas. Much of the prerequisite material is provided by
          brief reviews, making the book a self-contained reference
          tool. Also included are about 75 problems with solutions,
          illustrating applications of the material and methods for

  abstract  = {This paper presents a study of the local radio source
          population, by cross-comparing the data from the first data
          release (DR1) of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS)
          with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy
          spectroscopic sample. The LoTSS DR1 provides deep data
          (median rms noise of 71 $\mu$Jy at 150 MHz) over 424 square
          degrees of sky, which is sufficient to detect 10 615 (32
          per cent) of the SDSS galaxies over this sky area. An
          improved method to separate active galactic nuclei (AGN)
          accurately from sources with radio emission powered by star
          formation (SF) is developed and applied, leading to a
          sample of 2121 local (z {\textless} 0.3) radio AGN. The
          local 150 MHz luminosity function is derived for radio AGN
          and SF galaxies separately, and the good agreement with
          previous studies at 1.4 GHz suggests that the separation
          method presented is robust. The prevalence of radio AGN
          activity is confirmed to show a strong dependence on both
          stellar and black hole masses, remarkably reaching a
          fraction of 100 per cent of the most massive galaxies
          ({\textgreater} 1011 M?) displaying radio-AGN activity with
          L150 MHz >= 1021 W Hz-1; thus, the most massive galaxies
          are always switched on at some level. The results allow the
          full Eddington-scaled accretion rate distribution (a proxy
          for the duty cycle) to be probed for massive galaxies, and
          this accretion rate is found to peak at Lmech/LEdd ? 10-5.
          More than 50 per cent of the energy is released during the
          <=2 per cent of the time spent at the highest accretion
          rates, Lmech/LEdd {\textgreater} 10-2.5. Stellar mass is
          shown to be a more important driver of radio-AGN activity
          than black hole mass, suggesting a possible connection
          between the fuelling gas and the surrounding halo. This
          result is in line with models in which these radio AGN are
          essential for maintaining the quenched state of galaxies at
          the centres of hot gas haloes.},

  abstract  = {The nearby cluster Abell194 hosts two luminous, distorted
          radio galaxies. Both reside within the cluster's core
          region, being separated in projection by only 100 kpc. It
          is often suggested that tailed radio galaxies such as these
          reside in clusters that are under formation and are
          accreting new material from their outskirts. In this paper,
          we study the intriguing appearance of Abell 194, and test
          whether the cluster and radio source dynamics are
          consistent with the cluster formation/merger model. We
          analyse data from the XMM-Newton satellite and previously
          unpublished observations with the Very Large Array as well
          as present new data from the Giant Metre-Wave Radio
          Telescope (GMRT).
          
          The shape of the jets, and the lack of significant
          stripping of the galaxies' interstellar media, indicates
          that the radio galaxies are not moving at the large
          velocities they would have had if they were falling into
          the cluster from its outskirts; galaxy velocities of
          {\textless}=300kms-1 are adequate instead. A plausible
          scenario that could explain the observations is that the
          dynamics of the cluster centre are relatively quiescent,
          with the dominant system of massive galaxies being bound
          and orbiting the cluster centre of mass. For plausible
          jet/plume speeds and densities and the galaxy dynamics
          implied by this picture of the cluster, we show that the
          observed jet structures can be explained without invoking a
          major cluster merger event.},

          radio galaxy classification based on morphology using deep
          learning methods with a focus on using a small scale
          dataset ({\textasciitilde} 2000 samples). We apply few-shot
          learning techniques based on Siamese Networks and transfer
          learning techniques using a pre-trained DenseNet model with
          advanced techniques like cyclical learning rate,
          discriminative learning to train the model rapidly. We
          achieve a classification accuracy of over 92\% using our
          best performing model with the biggest source of confusion
          being between Bent and FRII type galaxies. Our results show
          that focusing on a small but curated dataset along with the
          use of best practices to train the neural network can lead
          to good results. Automated classification techniques will
          be crucial for upcoming surveys with next generation radio

  abstract  = {We present a full-sky 100 $\mu$m map that is a reprocessed
          composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the
          zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed.
          Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining
          artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100
          and 240 $\mu$m data, we have constructed a map of the dust
          temperature so that the 100 $\mu$m map may be converted to
          a map proportional to dust column density. The dust
          temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but
          does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of
          5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE
          quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of
          filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at
          all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust
          map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but
          deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially
          conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward
          denser clouds and of formation of
          H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}
          in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds
          are deficient in dust emission, as expected. {\textless}P
          /{\textgreater}To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must
          first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a
          possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via
          a regression analysis of the 100 $\mu$m DIRBE map against
          the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections
          for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the
          DIRBE 25 $\mu$m flux. This procedure removes virtually all
          traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 $\mu$m map
          no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths,
          where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the
          CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW

          sr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}

          galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. {\textless}P
          /{\textgreater}The primary use of these maps is likely to
          be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate
          our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the
          colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per
          unit flux density of 100 $\mu$m emission. We find
          consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of
          a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well
          as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line
          strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the
          correlation of intrinsic B-V versus
          Mg{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}
          index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We
          demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the
          older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low
          and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be
          significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening.
          These dust maps will also be useful for estimating
          millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave
          background radiation experiments and for estimating soft
          X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

          identified and observed with a high degree of completeness
          down to magnitude around 18k. The redshifts are assumed to
          be cosmological. The distribution in space is found to be
          strongly non-uniform. The space density, in co-moving
          coordinates, is increasing with redshift z, such that at z
          = 1 the density is around 150 and 80 times the local (z =
          0) density, for qo = 0 and qo = 1, respectively. This
          density increase corresponds to a N(S) relation quite
          {\textasciitilde}imi1ar to that exhibited by extragalactic
          radio sources. The optical luminosity function is

  abstract  = {The volume of data that will be produced by the next
          generation of astrophysical instruments represents a
          significant opportunity for making unplanned and unexpected
          discoveries. Conversely, finding unexpected objects or
          phenomena within such large volumes of data presents a
          challenge that may best be solved using computational and
          statistical approaches. We present the application of a
          coarse-grained complexity measure for identifying
          interesting observations in large astronomical data sets.
          This measure, which has been termed apparent complexity,
          has been shown to model human intuition and perceptions of
          complexity. Apparent complexity is computationally
          efficient to derive and can be used to segment and identify
          interesting observations in very large data sets based on
          their morphological complexity. We show, using data from
          the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey, that apparent
          complexity can be combined with clustering methods to
          provide an automated process for distinguishing between
          images of galaxies which have been classified as having
          simple and complex morphologies. The approach generalizes
          well when applied to new data after being calibrated on a
          smaller data set, where it performs better than tested
          classification methods using pixel data. This
          generalizability positions apparent complexity as a
          suitable machine-learning feature for identifying complex
          observations with unanticipated features.},

          z <= 0.1) radio galaxies with optical counterparts to
          address the question of how long a typical galaxy spends in
          radio active and quiescent states. The length of the active
          phase has a strong dependence on the stellar mass of the
          host galaxy. Radio sources in the most massive hosts are
          also retriggered more frequently. The time spent in the
          active phase has the same dependence on stellar mass as
          does the gas cooling rate, suggesting the onset of the
          quiescent phase is due to fuel depletion. We find radio and
          emission-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity to be
          independent, consistent with these corresponding to
          different accretion states.},

          flow of influence between entities. The Influence Flower is
          an ego-centric graph, with a query entity placed in the
          centre. The petals are styled to reflect the strength of
          influence to and from other entities of the same or
          different type. For example, one can break down the
          incoming and outgoing influences of a research lab by
          research topics. The Influence Flower uses a recent
          snapshot of Microsoft Academic Graph, consisting of
          212million authors, their 176 million publications, and 1.2
          billion citations. An interactive web app, Influence Map,
          is constructed around this central metaphor for searching
          and curating visualisations. We also propose a visual
          comparison method that highlights change in influence
          patterns over time. We demonstrate through several case
          studies that the Influence Flower supports data-driven
          inquiries about the following: researchers' careers over
          time; paper(s) and projects, including those with delayed
          recognition; the interdisciplinary profile of a research
          institution; and the shifting topical trends in
          conferences. We also use this tool on influence data beyond
          academic citations, by contrasting the academic and Twitter
          activities of a researcher.},

          divergence, minimum discrimination information, minimum
          relative entropy) is summarized, discussed, and applied to
          the classical problem of estimating power spectra given
          values of the autocorrelation function. This new method
          differs from previous methods in its explicit inclusion of
          a prior estimate of the power spectrum, and it reduces to
          maximum entropy spectral analysis as a special case. The
          prior estimate can be viewed as a means of shaping the
          spectral estimator. Cross-entropy minimization yields a
          family of shaped spectral estimators consistent with known
          autocorrelations. Results are derived in two equivalent
          ways: once by minimizing the cross-entropy of underlying
          probability densities, and once by arguments concerning the
          cross-entropy between the input and output of linear
          filters. Several example minimum cross-entropy spectra are

  abstract  = {We argue that the magnetic flux threading the black hole
          (BH), rather than BH spin or Eddington ratio, is the
          dominant factor in launching powerful jets and thus
          determining the radio loudness of active galactic nuclei
          (AGNs). Most AGNs are radio quiet because the thin
          accretion disks that feed them are inefficient in
          depositing magnetic flux close to the BH. Flux accumulation
          is more likely to occur during a hot accretion (or thick
          disk) phase, and we argue that radio-loud quasars and
          strong emission-line radio galaxies occur only when a
          massive, cold accretion event follows an episode of hot
          accretion. Such an event might be triggered by the merger
          of a giant elliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy. This
          picture supports the idea that flux accumulation can lead
          to the formation of a so-called magnetically choked
          accretion flow. The large observed range in radio loudness
          reflects not only the magnitude of the flux pressed against
          the BH, but also the decrease in UV flux from the disk, due
          to its disruption by the "magnetosphere" associated with
          the accumulated flux. While the strongest jets result from
          the secular accumulation of flux, moderate jet activity can
          also be triggered by fluctuations in the magnetic flux
          deposited by turbulent, hot inner regions of otherwise thin
          accretion disks, or by the dissipation of turbulent fields
          in accretion disk coronae. These processes could be
          responsible for jet production in Seyferts and
          low-luminosity AGNs, as well as jets associated with X-ray
          binaries.},

          is supported over the contexts which co-occur with the

          from the perspective of Optimal Transport and take

          to z 5, which have typical stellar masses within 3
          {\texttimes} (1010 - 1011)M?, and 3 GHz radio data in the
          COSMOS field, we derived the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity
          functions for radio AGN (L1.4 GHz 1022 - 1027 W Hz-1) out
          to z 5. We constrained the evolution of this population via
          continuous models of pure density and pure luminosity
          evolutions, and we found best-fit parametrizations of
          $\Phi$* ? (1 + z)(2.00 {\textpm} 0.18) - (0.60 {\textpm}
          0.14)z, and L* ? (1 + z)(2.88 {\textpm} 0.82) - (0.84
          {\textpm} 0.34)z, respectively, with a turnover in number
          and luminosity densities of the population at z ? 1.5. We
          converted 1.4 GHz luminosity to kinetic luminosity taking
          uncertainties of the scaling relation used into account. We
          thereby derived the cosmic evolution of the kinetic
          luminosity density provided by the AGN and compared this
          luminosity density to the radio-mode AGN feedback assumed
          in the Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) model, I.e.,
          to the redshift evolution of the central supermassive black
          hole accretion luminosity taken in the model as the source
          of heating that offsets the energy losses of the cooling,
          hot halo gas, and thereby limits further stellar mass
          growth of massive galaxies. We find that the kinetic
          luminosity exerted by our radio AGN may be high enough to
          balance the radiative cooling of the hot gas at each cosmic
          epoch since z 5. However, although our findings support the
          idea of radio-mode AGN feedback as a cosmologically
          relevant process in massive galaxy formation, many
          simplifications in both the observational and semi-analytic

          interaction of a light hypersonic jet with an inhomogeneous
          thermal and turbulently supported disk in an elliptical
          galaxy. These simulations are applicable to the GPS/CSS
          phase of extragalactic radio sources. The interstellar
          medium in these simulations consists of a conventional hot
          (T{\textasciitilde}107 K) component together with a warm
          (T{\textasciitilde}104 K) turbulently supported disk whose
          local density is described by a lognormal density
          distribution and whose spatial structure is realized from a
          fractal power law. We model the jet as a light, supersonic
          nonrelativistic flow with parameters selected to be
          consistent with a relativistic jet with kinetic power just
          above the FR1/FR2 break. We identify four generic phases in
          the evolution of such a jet with the inhomogeneous
          interstellar medium: (1) an initial ``flood and channel''
          phase, where progress is characterized by high-pressure gas
          finding changing weak points in the ISM, flowing through
          channels that form and reform over time; (2) a spherical,
          energy-driven bubble phase, where the bubble is larger than
          the disk scale, but the jet remains fully disrupted close
          to the nucleus; (3) a subsequent, rapid, jet break-out
          phase where the jet breaks free of the last obstructing
          dense clouds, becomes collimated once more, and pierces the
          spherical bubble; and (4) a classical phase, where the jet
          propagates in a momentum-dominated fashion similar to jets
          in single-component hot halos, leading to the classical
          jet-cocoon-bow shock structure. Mass transport in the
          simulations is investigated, and we propose a model for the
          morphology and component proper motions in the well-studied
          compact symmetric object 4C 31.04.},

  abstract  = {We have re-analyzed the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data to
          derive rotation measures (RMs) toward 37,543 polarized
          radio sources. The resulting catalog of RM values covers
          the sky area north of declination
          {\textendash}40{\textdegree} with an average density of
          more than one RM per square degree. We present an image of
          the median RM over 82\% of the sky with a resolution of
          8{\textdegree} and a typical error of {\textpm}1-2 rad
          m{\textendash}2. The image shows large-scale structures in
          RM that extend to very high Galactic latitudes. A simple
          analysis of the RM structure at high Galactic latitudes is
          used to derive properties of the Galactic halo magnetic
          field in the solar neighborhood. We find the component of
          the local field perpendicular to the plane (the
          z-component) equal to +0.30 $\mu$G for z 0. The reversal of
          sign across the Galactic plane is consistent with a
          quadrupole field geometry for the poloidal component of the
          halo field. The halo magnetic field component parallel to
          the disk is also found to be antisymmetric and generally
          consistent with a toroidal field, with strength +0.83
          $\mu$G for z 0. We have identified five regions of the sky
          where the foreground median RM is consistently less than 1
          rad m{\textendash}2 over several degrees. These holes in
          the foreground RM will be useful for future studies of
          possible small-scale fluctuations in cosmic magnetic field
          structures. In addition to allowing measurement of RMs
          toward polarized sources, the new analysis of the NVSS data
          removes the effects of bandwidth depolarization for
          {\textbar}RM{\textbar} ? 100 rad m{\textendash}2 inherent
          in the original NVSS source catalog. This new catalog of
          RMs and polarized flux densities is available online, and
          will be a valuable resource for further studies of the
          Galactic magnetic field and magnetoionic medium, and
          extragalactic magnetic fields.},

          past decade; discussion of arrays that now span the full
          range of the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum
          observable from the ground, 10 MHz to 1 THz; an analysis of
          factors that affect array speed; and an expanded discussion
          of digital signal-processing techniques and of
          scintillation phenomena and the effects of atmospheric
          water vapor on image distortion, among many other
          topics.With its comprehensiveness and detailed exposition
          of all aspects of the theory and practice of radio
          interferometry and synthesis imaging, this book has
          established itself as a standard reference in the field. It
          begins with an overview of the basic principles of radio
          astronomy, a short history of the development of radio
          interferometry, and an elementary discussion of the
          operation of an interferometer. From this foundation, it
          delves into the underlying relationships of interferometry,
          sets forth the coordinate systems and parameters to
          describe synthesis imaging, and examines configurations of
          antennas for multielement synthesis arrays. Various aspects
          of the design and response of receiving systems are
          discussed, as well as the special requirements of
          very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), image
          reconstruction, and recent developments in image
          enhancement techniques and astrometric observations. Also
          discussed are propagation effects in the media between the
          source and the observer, and radio interference, factors
          that limit performance. Related techniques are introduced,
          including intensity interferometry, optical interferometry,
          lunar occultations, tracking of satellites in Earth orbit,
          interferometry for remote Earth sensing, and holographic
          measurements of antenna surfaces. This book will benefit
          anyone who is interested in radio interferometry techniques
          for astronomy, astrometry, geodesy, or electrical
          engineering.},

  abstract  = {We propose a novel class of Gaussian processes (GPs) whose
          spectra have compact support, meaning that their sample
          trajectories are almost-surely band limited. As a
          complement to the growing literature on spectral design of
          covariance kernels, the core of our proposal is to model
          power spectral densities through a rectangular function,
          which results in a kernel based on the sinc function with
          straightforward extensions to non-centred (around zero
          frequency) and frequency-varying cases. In addition to its
          use in regression, the relationship between the sinc kernel
          and the classic theory is illuminated, in particular, the
          Shannon-Nyquist theorem is interpreted as posterior
          reconstruction under the proposed kernel. Additionally, we
          show that the sinc kernel is instrumental in two
          fundamental signal processing applications: first, in
          stereo amplitude modulation, where the non-centred sinc
          kernel arises naturally. Second, for band-pass filtering,
          where the proposed kernel allows for a Bayesian treatment
          that is robust to observation noise and missing data. The
          developed theory is complemented with illustrative graphic
          examples and validated experimentally using real-world
          data.},

  abstract  = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so
          strongly on orientation that our current classification
          schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead
          of more interesting physical properties. Light from the
          centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick
          circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and
          ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets
          emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray
          light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes.
          Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation
          anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of
          AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type
          that gives rise to different classes through different
          orientations. This review describes the unification of
          radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and
          blazars. We describe the classification and general
          properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for
          anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration
          and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible
          unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the
          high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous
          radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples
          biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population
          statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available
          data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and
          high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably
          are powered by similar physical processes, at least within
          the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with
          unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a
          serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified
          schemes that are suggested by realistic physical
          considerations; these will be important to consider when
          more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become
          available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we
          believe are the most pressing in this field. (SECTION:

          is challenging for astronomical surveys, particularly in
          radio interferometry images where the noise is correlated.
          Machine learning is a promising solution, allowing the
          development of algorithms tailored to specific telescope
          arrays and science cases. We present DEEPSOURCE - a deep
          learning solution - that uses convolutional neural networks
          to achieve these goals. DEEPSOURCE enhances the SNR of the
          sources in the original map and then uses dynamic blob
          detection to detect sources. Trained and tested on two sets
          of 500 simulated 1{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 1{\textdegree}
          MeerKAT images with a total of 300 000 sources, DEEPSOURCE
          is essentially perfect in both purity and completeness down
          to SNR = 4 and outperforms PYBDSF in all metrics. For
          uniformly weighted images, it achieves a Purity
          {\texttimes} Completeness (PC) score at SNR = 3 of 0.73,
          compared to 0.31 for the best PYBDSF model. For natural
          weighting, we find a smaller improvement of \{\~{} \}
          40\{\{ per cent\}\} in the PC score at SNR = 3. If instead
          we ask where either of the purity or completeness first
          drops to 90\{\{ per cent\}\}, we find that DEEPSOURCE
          reaches this value at SNR = 3.6 compared to the 4.3 of
          PYBDSF (natural weighting). A key advantage of DEEPSOURCE
          is that it can learn to optimally trade off purity and
          completeness for any science case under consideration. Our
          results show that deep learning is a promising approach to
          point source detection in astronomical images.},

          distributions introduce systematic uncertainties that
          affect observable-mass relations and selection functions of
          galaxy groups and clusters. However, the triaxial gas
          distributions depend on the non-linear physical processes
          of halo formation histories and baryonic physics, which are
          challenging to model accurately. In this study we explore a
          machine learning approach for modelling the dependence of
          gas shapes on dark matter and baryonic properties. With
          data from the Illustris-TNG hydrodynamical cosmological
          simulations, we develop a machine learning pipeline that
          applies XGBoost, an implementation of gradient boosted
          decision trees, to predict radial profiles of gas shapes
          from halo properties. We show that XGBoost models can
          accurately predict gas shape profiles in dark matter
          haloes. We also explore model interpretability with SHAP, a
          method that identifies the most predictive properties at
          different halo radii. We find that baryonic properties best
          predict gas shapes in halo cores, whereas dark matter
          shapes are the main predictors in the halo outskirts. This
          work demonstrates the power of interpretable machine
          learning in modelling observable properties of dark matter

  abstract  = {Magnetic fields pervade the interstellar medium (ISM), but
          are difficult to detect and characterize. The new
          generation of low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the
          Low Frequency Array (LOFAR: a Square Kilometre Array-low
          pathfinder), provides advancements in our capability of
          probing Galactic magnetism through low-frequency
          polarimetry. Maps of diffuse polarized radio emission and
          the associated Faraday rotation can be used to infer
          properties of, and trace structure in, the magnetic fields
          in the ISM. However, to date very little of the sky has
          been probed at high angular and Faraday depth resolution.
          We observed a 5{\textdegree} by 5{\textdegree} region
          centred on the nearby galaxy IC 342 (l =
          138.2{\textdegree},b = + 10.6{\textdegree}) using the LOFAR
          high-band antennae in the frequency range 115-178 MHz. We
          imaged this region at 4'.5x3'.8 resolution and performed
          Faraday tomography to detect foreground Galactic polarized
          synchrotron emission separated by Faraday depth (different
          amounts of Faraday rotation). Our Faraday depth cube shows
          a rich polarized structure, with up to 30 K of polarized
          emission at 150 MHz. We clearly detect two polarized
          features that extend over most of the field, but are
          clearly separated in Faraday depth. Simulations of the
          behaviour of the depolarization of Faraday-thick structures
          at such low frequencies show that such structures would be
          too strongly depolarized to explain the observations. These
          structures are therefore rejected as the source of the
          observed polarized features. Only Faraday thin structures
          will not be strongly depolarized at low frequencies;
          producing such structures requires localized variations in
          the ratio of synchrotron emissivity to Faraday depth per
          unit distance. Such variations can arise from several
          physical phenomena, such as a transition between regions of
          ionized and (mostly) neutral gas. We conclude that the
          observed polarized emission is Faraday thin, and propose
          that the emission originates from two mostly neutral clouds
          in the local ISM. Using maps of the local ISM to estimate
          distances to these clouds, we have modelled the Faraday
          rotation for this line of sight and estimated that the
          strength of the line of sight component of magnetic field
          of the local ISM for this direction varies between -0.86
          and+0.12 $\mu$G (where positive is towards the Earth). We
          propose that this may be a useful method for mapping
          magnetic fields within the local ISM in all directions
          towards nearby neutral clouds.

          surveys to galaxies of the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS)
          using an image-level algorithm that properly treats the
          extended structure of radio sources. Results. The bright
          master sample we present contains 575 radio-emitting
          galaxies with a flux greater than 213 mJy at 1.4 GHz. Over
          30\% of the galaxies in our catalog are not contained in
          existing large-area extra-galactic radio samples. We
          compute the optical and radio luminosity functions and the
          fraction of radio galaxies as a function of galaxy
          luminosity. 94\% of the radio galaxies within z = 0.03 are
          of Hubble type E/S0. The local galaxy density in a sphere
          of 2 Mpc centered on the radio galaxies is 1.7 times higher
          than around non-radio galaxies of the same luminosity and
          morphology, which is a statistically significant
          enhancement ({\textgreater}3$\sigma$). Conclusions. Our
          sample presents the deepest all-sky catalog of low-power
          radio galaxies. The observed enhancement of the galaxy
          density around radio galaxies suggests a causal relation
          between external galaxy properties, such as environment or
          merger history, and the formation of powerful jets in the
          present universe. Since the enhancement is observed with
          respect to galaxies of the same luminosity and Hubble type,
          it is not primarily driven by black hole mass. Our
          automated matching procedure is found to select
          radio-emitting galaxies with high efficiency (99\%) and
          purity (91\%), which is key for future processing of

          acoustic-phonetic features and the temporal relationships
          between them independently of position in time and

          recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the

          Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) Survey (CRAFTS) utilizes
          the novel drift-scan commensal survey mode of FAST and can
          generate billions of pulsar candidate signals. The human
          experts are not likely to thoroughly examine these signals,
          and various machine sorting methods are used to aid the
          classification of the FAST candidates. In this study, we
          propose a new ensemble classification system for pulsar
          candidates. This system denotes the further development of
          the pulsar image-based classification system (PICS), which
          was used in the Arecibo Telescope pulsar survey, and has
          been retrained and customized for the FAST drift-scan
          survey. In this study, we designed a residual network model
          comprising 15 layers to replace the convolutional neural
          networks (CNNs) in PICS. The results of this study
          demonstrate that the new model can sort {\textgreater}96\%
          of real pulsars to belong the top 1\% of all candidates and
          classify {\textgreater}1.6 million candidates per day using
          a dual-GPU and 24-core computer. This increased speed and
          efficiency can help to facilitate real-time or
          quasi-real-time processing of the pulsar-search data stream
          obtained from CRAFTS. In addition, we have published the
          labeled FAST data used in this study online, which can aid
          in the development of new deep learning techniques for

          growth in the local universe (z? 0.1) can be described by
          two separate, mass-independent Eddington ratio distribution
          functions (ERDFs). We assume that black holes can be
          divided into two independent groups: those with radiatively
          efficient accretion, primarily hosted by optically blue and
          green galaxies, and those with radiatively inefficient
          accretion, which are mainly found in red galaxies. With
          observed galaxy stellar mass functions as input, we show
          that the observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity
          functions can be reproduced by using mass-independent,
          broken power-law-shaped ERDFs. We use the observed hard
          X-ray and 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions to constrain
          the ERDF for radiatively efficient and inefficient AGNs,
          respectively. We also test alternative ERDF shapes and
          mass-dependent models. Our results are consistent with a
          mass-independent AGN fraction and AGN hosts being randomly
          drawn from the galaxy population. We argue that the ERDF is
          not shaped by galaxy-scale effects, but by how efficiently
          material can be transported from the inner few parsecs to
          the accretion disc. Our results are incompatible with the
          simplest form of mass quenching where massive galaxies host
          higher accretion rate AGNs. Furthermore, if reaching a
          certain Eddington ratio is a sufficient condition for
          maintenance mode, it can occur in all red galaxies, not
          just the most massive ones.},

  abstract  = {Cross-identifying complex radio sources with optical or
          infrared counterparts in surveys such as the Australia
          Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) has traditionally been
          performed by a visual inspection of individual sources.
          However, with new surveys from the Australian Square
          Kilometre Array Pathfinder detecting many tens of million
          of radio sources such an approach is no longer feasible.
          The Likelihood Ratio (LR) allows the use of additional data
          about survey objects to be cross matched rather than just
          position and proximity, such as flux, probability
          distribution and catalogue surface density. This thesis
          presents a new software algorithm (LRPY - Likelihood Ratio
          in PYthon) to automate the process of cross-identifying
          radio sources with catalogues at other wavelengths using
          the LR. I demonstrate LRPY by applying it to the ATLAS Data
          Release 3 and a Spitzer-based multi-wavelength catalogue,
          identifying 3,848 cross matched sources using my LR-based
          selection criteria. I found that LRPY could be extended to
          identify radio sources with multiple infrared counterparts
          many of which I identify as interacting galaxy pairs. In
          addition I also investigated if LRPY could be used to
          select radio sources with more complex morphology, such as
          double lobe radio sources. This extension to the algorithm
          is shown to work well in identifying the host of many
          double lobe radio sources. A subset of 1987 cross matched
          sources in this thesis have flux density values for all
          four bands in the Spitzer/IRAC instrument, which allowed me
          to use various criteria to distinguish between active
          galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFG). I
          found that 936 radio sources (?47\%) meet both of the Lacy
          and Stern AGN selection criteria. Of the matched sources,
          295 have spectroscopic redshifts and we examine the radio
          to infrared flux ratio vs redshift, proposing an AGN
          selection criterion below the Elvis radio-loud (RL) AGN
          limit for this dataset. Taking the union of all three AGN
          selection criteria I have identified 956 cross matched
          sources as AGN (?48\%). From this dataset, we find a
          decreasing fraction of AGN with lower radio flux densities
          consistent with other results in the literature. I found
          there is a strong power law correlation demonstrated using
          the complete Fusion dataset seen in the AGN arm of the MIR
          [3.6]-[5.8] vs [4.5]-[8.0] plot for the LACY AGN selection
          wedge, but there was no such strong correlation for the
          Stern AGN wedge of the MIR [5.8]-[8.0] vs [3.6]-[4.5]
          colour-colour plot. Due to this I have analysed the cross
          matched sources in this thesis for a power law
          relationship, it was apparent that for the MIR [3.6]-[5.8]
          vs [4.5]-[8.0] colour-colour plots used for Lacy AGN
          selection the correlation between the AGN candidate
          infrared flux ratios to the power-law locus is very strong
          in the AGN arm. The Stern MIR colour-colour criteria
          [5.8]-[8.0] vs [3.6]-[4.5] shows no strong correlation for
          the AGN candidate infrared flux ratios to the power-law
          locus for the cross matched sources. I have also looked at
          the relationship between the MIR 8.0$\mu$m to radio 1.4GHz
          relationship, there is a clear distinction between AGN and
          SFG's. I have also looked at the relationship between the
          Radio L1.4 GHz and MIR luminosities L3.6 $\mu$m and
          L4.5$\mu$m, as prior work had provided existence of a
          correlation. What was found is that the higher redshift
          sources (z{\textgreater}0.3) lie within the top right
          quadrant of the plots, when the Stern and Lacy AGN are
          identified we see the majority of these AGN also lie within
          this same quadrant. Looking at the AGN selected sources we
          see a slope close to unity at both MIR wavelengths, for
          3.6$\mu$m the slope is m = 1.004 {\textpm} 0.155 and at

          30{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ ) has been
          observed using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), which
          provides radio imaging of \$\~{}\$ 2 arcmin resolution at
          low frequencies (72-231 MHz). This is the GaLactic and
          Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey, and we have
          previously used a combination of visual inspection,
          cross-checks against the literature, and internal matching
          to identify the `brightest' radio-sources ( \$S\_\{151
          MHz\}{\textgreater}4\$ Jy) in the extragalactic catalogue
          (Galactic latitude, \${\textbar}b{\textbar}
          {\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$
          ). We refer to these 1 863 sources as the GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy)
          Sample, and use radio images (of \$\{<=\}45\$ arcsec
          resolution), and multi-wavelength information, to assess
          their morphology and identify the galaxy that is hosting
          the radio emission (where appropriate). Details of how to
          access all of the overlays used for this work are available
          at https://github.com/svw26/G4Jy. Alongside this we conduct
          further checks against the literature, which we document
          here for individual sources. Whilst the vast majority of
          the G4Jy Sample are active galactic nuclei with powerful
          radio-jets, we highlight that it also contains a nebula,
          two nearby, star-forming galaxies, a cluster relic, and a
          cluster halo. There are also three extended sources for
          which we are unable to infer the mechanism that gives rise
          to the low-frequency emission. In the G4Jy catalogue we
          provide mid-infrared identifications for 86\% of the
          sources, and flag the remainder as: having an uncertain
          identification (129 sources), having a
          faint/uncharacterised mid-infrared host (126 sources), or
          it being inappropriate to specify a host (2 sources). For
          the subset of 129 sources, there is ambiguity concerning
          candidate host-galaxies, and this includes four sources
          (B0424-728, B0703-451, 3C 198, and 3C 403.1) where we
          question the existing identification.},

  abstract  = {The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has observed the
          entire southern sky (Declination, \$$\delta${\textless}
          30{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ ) at low
          radio frequencies, over the range 72-231MHz. These
          observations constitute the GaLactic and Extragalactic
          All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey, and we use the extragalactic
          catalogue (EGC) (Galactic latitude, \${\textbar}b{\textbar}
          {\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$
          ) to define the GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample. This is a
          complete sample of the `brightest' radio sources (
          \$S\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{151 MHz\}\}{\textgreater}4
          Jy\$ ), the majority of which are active galactic nuclei
          with powerful radio jets. Crucially, low-frequency
          observations allow the selection of such sources in an
          orientation-independent way (i.e. minimising the bias
          caused by Doppler boosting, inherent in high-frequency
          surveys). We then use higher-resolution radio images, and
          information at other wavelengths, to morphologically
          classify the brightest components in GLEAM. We also conduct
          cross-checks against the literature and perform internal
          matching, in order to improve sample completeness (which is
          estimated to be \${\textgreater}95.5\$ \%). This results in
          a catalogue of 1863 sources, making the G4Jy Sample over 10
          times larger than that of the revised Third Cambridge
          Catalogue of Radio Sources (3CRR;
          \$S\_\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}textrm\{\vphantom{\}}178
          MHz\vphantom{\{}\}\vphantom{\{}\}{\textgreater}10.9 Jy\$ ).
          Of these G4Jy sources, 78 are resolved by the MWA (Phase-I)
          synthesised beam ( \$\~{}2\$ arcmin at 200MHz), and we
          label 67\% of the sample as `single', 26\% as `double', 4\%
          as `triple', and 3\% as having `complex' morphology at
          \$\~{}1 GHz\$ (45 arcsec resolution). We characterise the
          spectral behaviour of these objects in the radio and find
          that the median spectral index is \$$\alpha$=-0.740
          {\textpm} 0.012\$ between 151 and 843MHz, and
          \$$\alpha$=-0.786 {\textpm} 0.006\$ between 151MHz and
          1400MHz (assuming a power-law description, \$S\_\{$\nu$\} ?
          $\nu${\textasciicircum}\{$\alpha$\}\$ ), compared to
          \$$\alpha$=-0.829 {\textpm} 0.006\$ within the GLEAM band.
          Alongside this, our value-added catalogue provides
          mid-infrared source associations (subject to 6" resolution
          at 3.4 \$$\mu$\$ m) for the radio emission, as identified
          through visual inspection and thorough checks against the
          literature. As such, the G4Jy Sample can be used as a
          reliable training set for cross-identification via
          machine-learning algorithms. We also estimate the angular
          size of the sources, based on their associated components
          at \$\~{}1 GHz\$ , and perform a flux density comparison
          for 67 G4Jy sources that overlap with 3CRR. Analysis of
          multi-wavelength data, and spectral curvature between 72MHz
 and 20GHz, will be presented in subsequent papers, and details for accessing all G4Jy overlays are provided at tps://github.com/svw26/G4Jy.},

  abstract  = {The recent development of unified theories of active
          galactic nuclei (AGNs) has indicated that there are two
          physically distinct classes of these objects--radio-loud
          and radio-quiet. Despite differences, the (probable)
          thermal emissions from the AGNs (continua and lines from
          X-ray to infrared wavelengths) are quite similar to the two
          classes of object. We argue that this last result suggests
          that the black hole masses and mass accretion rates in the
          two classes are not greatly different, and that the
          difference between the classes is associated with the spin
          of the black hole. We assume that the normal process of
          accretion through a disk does not lead to rapidly spinning
          holes and propose that galaxies (e.g., spirals) which have
          not suffered a recent major merger event contain
          nonrotating or only slowly rotating black holes. When two
          such galaxies merge, the two black holes are known to form
          a binary and we assume that they eventually coalesce. The
          ratio of the number of radio-loud to radio-quiet AGNs at a
          given thermal (e.g., optical) luminosity is determined by
          the galaxy merger rate. Comparisons between the predicted
          and observed radio luminosity functions constrain the
          efficiencies with which jet power is extracted from the
          spinning hole and radio emission is produced by the jet.},

          randomly selected and nearly complete at r {\textless}
          19.5. We investigate the photometric redshift performance
          obtained with ugriz photometry from VSTATLAS and W1/W2 from
          WISE, based on several empirical and template methods. The
          best redshift errors are obtained with kernel-density
          estimation, as are the lowest biases, which are consistent
          with zero within statistical noise. The 68th percentiles of
          the redshift scatter for magnitude-limited samples at r
          {\textless} (15.5, 17.5, 19.5) are (0.014, 0.017, 0.028).
          In this magnitude range, there are no known ambiguities in
          the colour-redshift map, consistent with a small rate of
          redshift outliers. In the fainter regime, the KDE method
          produces p(z) estimates per galaxy that represent unbiased
          and accurate redshift frequency expectations. The p(z) sum
          over any subsample is consistent with the true redshift
          frequency plus Poisson noise. Further improvements in
          redshift precision at r {\textless} 20 would mostly be
          expected from filter sets with narrower passbands to
          increase the sensitivity of colours to small changes in

  abstract  = {We investigate the 1.4-GHz radio properties of 92 nearby
          (z {\textless} 0.05) ultra-hard X-ray selected active
          galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope
          (BAT) sample. Through the ultra-hard X-ray selection, we
          minimize the biases against obscured or Compton-thick AGNs
          as well as confusion with emission derived from star
          formation that typically affect AGN samples selected from
          the ultraviolet, optical and infrared wavelengths. We find
          that all the objects in our sample of nearby, ultra-hard
          X-ray selected AGNs are radio quiet; 83 per cent of the
          objects are classed as high-excitation galaxies and 17 per
          cent as low-excitation galaxies. While these low-z BAT
          sources follow the radio-far-infrared correlation in a
          similar fashion to star-forming galaxies, our analysis
          finds that there is still significant AGN contribution in
          the observed radio emission from these radio-quiet AGNs. In
          fact, the majority of our BAT sample occupy the same
          X-ray-radio Fundamental Plane as has been observed in other
          samples, which include radio-loud AGNs - evidence that the
          observed radio emission (albeit weak) is connected to the
          AGN accretion mechanism, rather than star formation.},

  abstract  = {We present the first data release of Radio Galaxy Zoo, an
          online citizen science project that enlists the help of the
          public to cross-match extended radio sources from the Faint
          Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) and
          the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) surveys,
          often with complex structure, to host galaxies in 3.6
          {\textmu}m infrared images from the Wide-field Infrared
          Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Spitzer Space Telescope.
          This first data release consists of 75,641 classifications
          for 71,399 radio sources from the FIRST survey and 582
          radio sources from the ATLAS survey. This first data
          release spans the classifications from the first 2.75 years
          of project operation and comes in the form of two tables:
          1) a table of radio galaxies with their matched radio
          source components; and 2) a table of crossmatched host
          galaxies. Radio sources with multiple radio components
          account for 11,093 sources out of the 71,982 sources
          presented in this data release. We find that more than half
          the multicomponent radio sources catalogued in DR1 is
          likely to have angular extents which are less than 500
          kpc.},

          provides end users with automated identification of radio

          sources in a fast ({\textless}200 ms per image) and
          accurate (>=90 per cent) fashion. Future work will improve
          CLARAN's relatively lower success rates in dealing with

  abstractnote  = {With the first direct detection of gravitational waves,
          the advanced laser interferometer gravitational-wave
          observatory (LIGO) has initiated a new field of astronomy
          by providing an alternative means of sensing the universe.
          The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is
          achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive
          components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave
          disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a
          variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise
          that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise
          features known as glitches, which are transient and
          non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough
          rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO
          detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range
          of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new
          morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they
          can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a
          robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the
          effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates
          that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This
          proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific
          Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In
          this paper we describe an innovative project that combines
          crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the
          challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches
          recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse
          platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public
          to categorize images of time-frequency representations of
          glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to
          discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve.
          In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to
          categorize images after being trained on human-classified
          examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the
          strengths of both classification methods, we create a
          combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency
          and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting
          classification and characterization should help LIGO

  abstract  = {With the first direct detection of gravitational waves,
          the advanced laser interferometer gravitational-wave
          observatory (LIGO) has initiated a new field of astronomy
          by providing an alternative means of sensing the universe.
          The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is
          achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive
          components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave
          disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a
          variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise
          that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise
          features known as glitches, which are transient and
          non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough
          rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO
          detectors is non-negligible. Glitches come in a wide range
          of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new
          morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they
          can obscure or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a
          robust characterization of glitches is paramount in the
          effort to achieve the gravitational-wave detection rates
          that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO. This
          proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific
          Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In
          this paper we describe an innovative project that combines
          crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the
          challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches
          recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse
          platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public
          to categorize images of time-frequency representations of
          glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to
          discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve.
          In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to
          categorize images after being trained on human-classified
          examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the
          strengths of both classification methods, we create a
          combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency
          and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting
          classification and characterization should help LIGO
          scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently
          eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely,
          thereby improving the rate and accuracy of
          gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these

  abstract  = {Context. We investigate the use of saliency-map analysis
          to aid in searches for transient signals, such as fast
          radio bursts and individual pulses from radio pulsars.
          Aims: Our aim is to demonstrate that saliency maps provide
          the means to understand predictions from machine learning
          algorithms and can be implemented in pipelines used to
          search for transient events. Methods: We implemented a new
          deep learning methodology to predict whether any segment of
          the data contains a transient event. The algorithm was
          trained using real and simulated data sets. We demonstrate
          that the algorithm is able to identify such events. The
          output results are visually analysed via the use of
          saliency maps. Results: We find that saliency maps can
          produce an enhanced image of any transient feature without
          the need for de-dispersion or removal of radio frequency
          interference. The maps can be used to understand which
          features in the image were used in making the machine
          learning decision and to visualise the transient event.
          Even though the algorithm reported here was developed to
          demonstrate saliency-map analysis, we have detected a
          single burst event, in archival data, with dispersion
          measure of 41 cm-3 pc that is not associated with any
          currently known pulsar.},

          physical correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and
          the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) remain
          highly controversial. We take advantage of a recently
          developed SFR estimator based on the [O II] $\lambda$3727
          and [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission lines to investigate the
          SFRs of the host galaxies of more than 5800 type-1 and 7600
          type-2 AGNs with z {\textless} 0.35. After matching in
          luminosity and redshift, we find that type-1 and type-2
          AGNs have a similar distribution of internal reddening,
          which is significant and corresponds to \~{}109 M? of cold
          molecular gas. In spite of their comparable gas content,
          type-2 AGNs, independent of stellar mass, Eddington ratio,
          redshift or molecular gas mass, exhibit intrinsically
          stronger star formation activity than type-1 AGNs, in
          apparent disagreement with the conventional AGN unified
          model. We observe a tight, linear relation between AGN
          luminosity (accretion rate) and SFR, one that becomes more
          significant toward smaller physical scales, suggesting that
          the link between the AGN and star formation occurs in the
          central kpc-scale region. This, along with a correlation
          between SFR and Eddington ratio in the regime of
          super-Eddington accretion, can be interpreted as evidence
          that star formation is impacted by positive feedback from
          the AGN.},

  abstract  = {We report the discovery of shocked molecular and ionized
          gas resulting from jet-driven feedback in the low-redshift
          (z = 0.0602) compact radio galaxy 4C 31.04 using near-IR
          imaging spectroscopy. 4C 31.04 is a \~{}100 pc double-lobed
          Compact Steep Spectrum source believed to be a very young
          active galactic nucleus (AGN). It is hosted by a giant
          elliptical with a \~{} 109 M\_? multiphase gaseous
          circumnuclear disc. We used high spatial resolution,
          adaptive optics-assisted H- and K-band integral field
          Gemini/NIFS observations to probe (1) the warm (\~{}103 K)
          molecular gas phase, traced by ro-vibrational transitions
          of H2, and (2), the warm ionized medium, traced by the [Fe
          II]\_\{1.644 $\mu$ m\} line. The [Fe II] emission traces
          shocked gas ejected from the disc plane by a jet-blown
          bubble 300-400 pc in diameter, while the H2 emission traces
          shock-excited molecular gas in the interior \~{} 1 kpc of
          the circumnuclear disc. Hydrodynamical modelling shows that
          the apparent discrepancy between the extent of the shocked
          gas and the radio emission can occur when the brightest
          regions of the synchrotron-emitting plasma are temporarily
          halted by dense clumps, while less bright plasma can
          percolate through the porous ISM and form an energy-driven
          bubble that expands freely out of the disc plane.
          Simulations suggest that this bubble is filled with low
          surface brightness plasma not visible in existing VLBI
          observations of 4C 31.04 due to insufficient sensitivity.
          Additional radial flows of jet plasma may percolate to \~{}
          kpc radii in the circumnuclear disc, driving shocks and
          accelerating clouds of gas, giving rise to the H2 emission.},

  abstract  = {It is widely suspected that active galactic nucleus (AGN)
          activity ultimately sweeps galaxies clear of their gas. We
          work out the observable properties required to achieve
          this. Large-scale AGN-driven outflows should have kinetic
          luminosities {\textasciitilde}$\eta$ L Edd/2
          {\textasciitilde} 0.05 L Edd and momentum rates
          {\textasciitilde}20 L Edd/c, where L Edd is the Eddington
          luminosity of the central black hole and $\eta$
          {\textasciitilde} 0.1 its radiative accretion efficiency.
          This creates an expanding two-phase medium in which
          molecular species coexist with hot gas, which can persist
          after the central AGN has switched off. This picture
          predicts outflow velocities {\textasciitilde}1000-1500 km
          s-1 and mass outflow rates up to 4000 M ? yr-1 on kpc
          scales, fixed mainly by the host galaxy velocity dispersion
          (or equivalently black hole mass). All these features agree
          with those of outflows observed in galaxies such as Mrk231.
          This strongly suggests that AGN activity is what sweeps
          galaxies clear of their gas on a dynamical timescale and
          makes them red and dead. We suggest future observational
          tests of this picture.},

  abstract  = {We present the catalogue of Radio sources associated with
          Optical Galaxies and having Unresolved or Extended
          morphologies I (ROGUE I). It was generated by
          cross-matching galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
          Data Release 7 (SDSS DR 7) as well as radio sources from
          the First Images of Radio Sky at Twenty Centimetre (FIRST)
          and the National Radio Astronomical Observatory VLA Sky
          Survey (NVSS) catalogues. We created the largest handmade
          catalogue of visually classified radio objects and
          associated with them optical host galaxies, containing
          32,616 galaxies with a FIRST core within 3 arcsec of the
          optical position. All listed objects possess the good
          quality SDSS DR 7 spectra with the signal-to-noise ratio
          \${\textgreater}\$10 and spectroscopic redshifts up to
          \$z=0.6\$. The radio morphology classification was
          performed by a visual examination of the FIRST and the NVSS
          contour maps overlaid on a DSS image, while an optical
          morphology classification was based on the 120 arcsec
          snapshot images from SDSS DR 7. The majority of radio
          galaxies in ROGUE I, i.e. \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 93\%, are
          unresolved (compact or elongated), while the rest of them
          exhibit extended morphologies, such as Fanaroff-Riley (FR)
          type I, II, and hybrid, wide-angle tail, narrow-angle tail,
          head-tail sources, and sources with intermittent or
          reoriented jet activity, i.e. double-double, X-shaped, and
          Z-shaped. Most of FR IIs have low radio luminosities,
          comparable to the luminosities of FR Is. Moreover, due to
          visual check of all radio maps and optical images, we were
          able to discover or reclassify a number of radio objects as
          giant, double-double, X-shaped, and Z-shaped radio
          galaxies. The presented sample can serve as a database for
          training automatic methods of identification and
          classification of optical and radio galaxies.},
