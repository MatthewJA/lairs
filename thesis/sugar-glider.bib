    abstract = {We extend the rotation measure work of Burn (1966) to the cases of limited sampling of λ2 space and non-constant emission spectra. We introduce the rotation measure transfer function (RMTF), which is an excellent predictor of nπ ambiguity problems with the λ2 coverage. Rotation measure synthesis can be implemented very eﬃciently on modern computers. Because the analysis is easily applied to wide ﬁelds, one can conduct very fast RM surveys of weak spatially extended sources. Diﬃcult situations, for example multiple sources along the line of sight, are easily detected and transparently handled. Under certain conditions, it is even possible to recover the emission as a function of Faraday depth within a single cloud of ionized gas. Rotation measure synthesis has already been successful in discovering widespread, weak, polarized emission associated with the Perseus cluster (de Bruyn \& Brentjens 2005). In simple, high signal to noise situations it is as good as traditional linear ﬁts to χ versus λ2 plots. However, when the situation is more complex or very weak polarized emission at high rotation measures is expected, it is the only viable option.},

Recent work has shown that apparently simple Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) spectra can be generated by complex sources. This is true even when the distribution of RMs in the complex source greatly exceeds the errors associated with a single component ﬁt to the peak of the Faraday spectrum. We present a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can diﬀerentiate between simple Faraday thin spectra and those that contain multiple or Faraday thick sources. We demonstrate that this CNN, trained for the upcoming Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism (POSSUM) early science observations, can identify two component sources 99\% of the time, provided that the sources are separated in Faraday depth by {\textgreater}10\% of the FWHM of the Faraday Point Spread Function, the polarized ﬂux ratio of the sources is {\textgreater}0.1, and that the Signal-to-Noise radio (S/N) of the primary component is {\textgreater}5. With this S/N cut-oﬀ, the false positive rate (simple sources mis-classiﬁed as complex) is {\textless}0.3\%.

We use a general-purpose, polarization model-fitting procedure that describes the Faraday rotation measure (RM) and intrinsic polarization structure of up to three distinct polarized emission regions or `RM components' of a source. Overall, 37 per cent/52 per cent/11 per cent of sources are best fitted by one/two/three RM components. However, these fractions are dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in polarization (more RM components more likely at higher S/N). In general, our analysis shows that sources with high integrated degrees of polarization at 1.4 GHz have low Faraday depolarization, are typically dominated by a single RM component, have a steep spectral index and have a high intrinsic degree of polarization. After classifying our sample into radiative-mode and jet-mode AGN, we find no significant difference between the Faraday rotation or Faraday depolarization properties of jet-mode and radiative-mode AGN. However, there is a statistically significant difference in the intrinsic degree of polarization between the two types, with the jet-mode sources having more intrinsically ordered magnetic field structures than the radiative-mode sources. We also find a preferred perpendicular orientation of the intrinsic magnetic field structure of jet-mode AGN with respect to the jet direction, while no clear preference is found for the radiative-mode sources.},

mostly unresolved radio sources between 1.3 and 2.0 GHz using data taken

rotation-measure synthesis to identify Faraday-complex polarized
sources, those objects whose frequency-dependent polarization behavior
indicates the presence of material possessing complicated magnetoionic
structure along the line of sight (LOS). For sources classified as
Faraday-complex, we have analyzed a number of their radio and
multiwavelength properties to determine whether they differ from
Faraday-simple polarized sources (sources for which LOS magnetoionic
structures are comparatively simple) in these properties. We use this
information to constrain the physical nature of the magnetoionic
structures responsible for generating the observed complexity. We detect
Faraday complexity in 12\% of polarized sources at ∼1‧
resolution, but we demonstrate that underlying signal-to-noise
limitations mean the true percentage is likely to be significantly
higher in the polarized radio source population. We find that the
properties of Faraday-complex objects are diverse, but that complexity
is most often associated with depolarization of extended radio sources
possessing a relatively steep total intensity spectrum. We find an
association between Faraday complexity and LOS structure in the Galactic
interstellar medium (ISM) and claim that a significant proportion of the
Faraday complexity we observe may be generated at interfaces of the ISM
associated with ionization fronts near neutral hydrogen structures.
Galaxy cluster environments and internally generated Faraday complexity
provide possible alternative explanations in some cases.},

 abstractNote={Modern data sets in many applications no longer comprise samples of real vectors in a real vector space but samples of much more complex structures which may be represented as points in a space with certain underlying geometric structure, namely a manifold. Manifold learning is an emerging field for learning the underlying structure. The study of manifold learning can be split into two main branches, namely dimension reduction and manifold fitting. With the aim of interacting statistics and geometry, we tackle the problem of manifold fitting in the ambient space. Inspired by the relation between the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the geometry of a manifold, we aim to find a small set of points that preserve the geometry of the underlying manifold. Based on this relationship, we extend the idea of subsampling to noisy datasets in high dimensional space and utilize the Moving Least Squares (MLS) approach to approximate the underlying manifold. We analyze the two core steps in our proposed method theoretically and also provide the bounds for the MLS approach. Our simulation results and real data analysis demonstrate the superiority of our method in estimating the underlying manifold from noisy data.},

They are motivated by certain ﬁltering problems. First we quantify the degradation of performance of a predictor which is designed for a particular spectral density function and then it is used to predict the values of a random process having a different spectral density. The logarithm of the ratio between the variance of the error, over the corresponding minimal (optimal) variance, produces a measure of distance between the two power spectra with several desirable properties. Analogous quantities based on smoothing problems produce alternative distances and suggest a class of measures based on fractions of generalized means of ratios of power spectral densities. These distance measures endow the manifold of spectral density functions with a (pseudo) Riemannian metric. We pursue one of the possible options for a distance measure, characterize the relevant geodesics, and compute corresponding distances.}, note={arXiv: math/0607026}, journal={arXiv:math/0607026}, author={Georgiou, Tryphon T.}, year={2006}, month={Jul} }

An important application is in the banking industry, where statistical models are applied to loans to determine provisions and capital requirements. These models are developed on historical data, and regulations require their monitoring to ensure they remain valid on current portfolios&mdash;often years since the models were developed. The Population Stability Index (PSI) is an industry standard to measure whether the distribution of the current data has shifted significantly from the distribution of data used to develop the model. This paper explores several disadvantages of the PSI and proposes the Prediction Accuracy Index (PAI) as an alternative. The superior properties and interpretation of the PAI are discussed and it is concluded that the PAI can more accurately summarise the level of population stability, helping risk analysts and managers determine whether the model remains fit-for-purpose.}, number={2}, journal={Risks}, author={Taplin, Ross and Hunt, Clive}, year={2019}, month={Jun}, pages={53} }

The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals.}, note={arXiv: 1704.02828}, journal={arXiv:1704.02828 [stat]}, author={Ambrogioni, Luca and Maris, Eric}, year={2017}, month={Dec} }

Analyses for these applications assume that mutagenic mechanisms have a distinct relationship with neighboring bases that allows them to be distinguished. Direct support for this assumption is limited to a small number of simple cases, e.g., CpG hypermutability. We have evaluated whether the mechanistic origin of a point mutation can be resolved using only sequence context for a more complicated case. We contrasted single nucleotide variants originating from the multitude of mutagenic processes that normally operate in the mouse germline with those induced by the potent mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). The considerable overlap in the mutation spectra of these two samples make this a challenging problem. Employing a new, robust log-linear modeling method, we demonstrate that neighboring bases contain information regarding point mutation direction that differs between the ENU-induced and spontaneous mutation variant classes. A logistic regression classifier exhibited strong performance at discriminating between the different mutation classes. Concordance between the feature set of the best classifier and information content analyses suggest our results can be generalized to other mutation classification problems. We conclude that machine learning can be used to build a practical classification tool to identify the mutation mechanism for individual genetic variants.

 title={The Faraday rotation measure synthesis technique}, volume={259}, DOI={10.1017/S1743921309031421}, abstractNote={We discuss practical aspects of the novel Faraday Rotation Measure Synthesis technique, first described by Burn (1966), and recently extended and implemented by Brentjens & de Bruyn (2005). The method takes advantage of the excellent spectral coverage provided by modern radio telescopes to reconstruct the intrinsic polarization properties along a line of sight, using a Fourier relationship between the observed polarization products and a function describing the intrinsic
polarization (the Faraday dispersion function). An important consequence of the Fourier relationship and discrete frequency sampling is the need, in some cases, to deconvolve the sampling response from the
reconstructed Faraday dispersion function. Practical aspects of the deconvolution procedure are discussed. We illustrate the use of the technique by summarizing a recent investigation carried out with the WSRT. We conclude by briefly describing the applicability to future programs which will be carried out with the next generation of radio telescopes such as LOFAR.}, author={Heald, George}, year={2009}, month={Apr}, pages={591–602} }

 title={DASH: Deep Learning for the Automated Spectral Classification of Supernovae and Their Hosts}, volume={885}, DOI={10.3847/1538-4357/ab48f4}, abstractNote={We present DASH (Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier), a novel 
software package that automates the classification of the type, age,
redshift, and host galaxy of supernova spectra. DASH makes use of a new
approach that does not rely on iterative template-matching techniques
like all previous software, but instead classifies based on the learned
features of each supernova’s type and age. It has achieved this by
employing a deep convolutional neural network to train a matching
algorithm. This approach has enabled DASH to be orders of magnitude
faster than previous tools, being able to accurately classify hundreds
or thousands of objects within seconds. We have tested its performance
on 4 yr of data from the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES). The deep
learning models were developed using TensorFlow and were trained using
over 4000 supernova spectra taken from the CfA Supernova Program and the
Berkeley SN Ia Program as used in SNID (Supernova Identification
software). Unlike template-matching methods, the trained models are
independent of the number of spectra in the training data, which allows
for DASH’s unprecedented speed. We have developed both a graphical
interface for easy visual classification and analysis of supernovae and
a Python library for the autonomous and quick classification of several
supernova spectra. The speed, accuracy, user-friendliness, and
versatility of DASH present an advancement to existing spectral
classification tools. We have made the code publicly available on GitHub
and PyPI (pip install astrodash) to allow for further contributions and
development. The package documentation is available at https://astrodash.readthedocs.io.}, journal={The Astrophysical Journal}, author={Muthukrishna, Daniel and Parkinson, David and Tucker, Brad E.}, year={2019}, month={Nov}, pages={85} }

 @article{lukic18compact,
 title={Radio Galaxy Zoo: compact and extended radio source classification with deep learning}, volume={476}, DOI={10.1093/mnras/sty163}, abstractNote={Machine learning techniques have been increasingly useful in 
astronomical applications over the last few years, for example in the
morphological classification of galaxies. Convolutional neural networks
have proven to be highly effective in classifying objects in image data.
In the context of radio-interferometric imaging in astronomy, we looked
for ways to identify multiple components of individual sources. To this
effect, we design a convolutional neural network to differentiate
between different morphology classes using sources from the Radio Galaxy
Zoo (RGZ) citizen science project. In this first step, we focus on
exploring the factors that affect the performance of such neural
networks, such as the amount of training data, number and nature of
layers, and the hyperparameters. We begin with a simple experiment in
which we only differentiate between two extreme morphologies, using
compact and multiple-component extended sources. We found that a
three-convolutional layer architecture yielded very good results,
achieving a classification accuracy of 97.4 per cent on a test data set.
The same architecture was then tested on a four-class problem where we
let the network classify sources into compact and three classes of
extended sources, achieving a test accuracy of 93.5 per cent. The
best-performing convolutional neural network set-up has been verified
against RGZ Data Release 1 where a final test accuracy of 94.8 per cent
was obtained, using both original and augmented images. The use of sigma
clipping does not offer a significant benefit overall, except in cases
with a small number of training images.}, journal={Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society}, author={Lukic, V. and Brüggen, M. and Banfield, J. K. and Wong, O. I. and Rudnick, L. and Norris, R. P. and Simmons, B.}, year={2018}, month={May}, pages={246–260} }

Such algorithms will also play a pivotal role in sending real-time triggers for prompt follow-ups with other instruments. In this paper, we have used the technique of Transfer Learning to train the state-of-the-art deep neural networks for
classification of FRB and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) candidates. These are convolutional neural networks which work on radio
frequency-time and dispersion measure-time images as the inputs. We trained these networks using simulated FRBs and real RFI candidates from telescopes at the Green Bank Observatory. We present 11 deep learning models, each with an accuracy and recall above 99.5% on our test dataset comprising of real RFI and pulsar candidates. As we demonstrate, these algorithms are telescope and frequency agnostic and are able to detect all FRBs with signal-to-noise ratios above 10 in ASKAP and Parkes data. We also provide an open-source python package FETCH (Fast Extragalactic Transient Candidate Hunter) for classification of candidates, using our models. Using FETCH, these models can be deployed along with any commensal search pipeline for real-time candidate classification.}, journal={Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society}, author={Agarwal, Devansh and Aggarwal, Kshitij and Burke-Spolaor, Sarah and Lorimer, Duncan R. and Garver-Daniels, Nathaniel}, year={2020}, month={Jun} }

 title={Convolutional neural networks: A magic bullet for gravitational-wave detection?}, volume={100}, ISSN={1550-7998}, DOI={10.1103/PhysRevD.100.063015}, abstractNote={In the last few years, machine learning techniques, in particular convolutional neural networks, have been investigated as a method to replace or complement traditional matched filtering techniques that are used to detect the gravitational-wave signature of merging black holes. However, to date, these methods have not yet been successfully applied to the analysis of long stretches of data recorded by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories. In this work, we critically examine the use of convolutional neural networks as a tool to search for merging black holes. We identify the strengths and limitations of this approach, highlight some common pitfalls in translating between machine learning and gravitational-wave astronomy, and discuss the
interdisciplinary challenges. In particular, we explain in detail why convolutional neural networks alone cannot be used to claim a
statistically significant gravitational-wave detection. However, we demonstrate how they can still be used to rapidly flag the times of potential signals in the data for a more detailed follow-up. Our convolutional neural network architecture as well as the proposed performance metrics are better suited for this task than a standard binary classifications scheme. A detailed evaluation of our approach on Advanced LIGO data demonstrates the potential of such systems as trigger generators. Finally, we sound a note of caution by constructing
adversarial examples, which showcase interesting “failure modes” of our model, where inputs with no visible resemblance to real
gravitational-wave signals are identified as such by the network with high confidence.}, journal={Physical Review D}, author={Gebhard, Timothy D. and Kilbertus, Niki and Harry, Ian and Schölkopf, Bernhard}, year={2019}, month={Sep}, pages={063015} }

 title={Gravity Spy: integrating advanced LIGO detector characterization, machine learning, and citizen science}, volume={34}, DOI={10.1088/1361-6382/aa5cea}, abstractNote={With the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the advanced 
laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) has initiated
a new field of astronomy by providing an alternative means of sensing
the universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections
is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of
LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is
still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources
of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise
features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in
their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental
coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. Glitches
come in a wide range of time-frequency-amplitude morphologies, with new
morphologies appearing as the detector evolves. Since they can obscure
or mimic true gravitational-wave signals, a robust characterization of
glitches is paramount in the effort to achieve the gravitational-wave
detection rates that are predicted by the design sensitivity of LIGO.
This proves a daunting task for members of the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration alone due to the sheer amount of data. In this paper we
describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine
learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the
glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse
platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize
images of time-frequency representations of glitches into pre-identified
morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the
detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to
categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of
the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both
classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of
improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The
resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO
scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate
them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate
and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these
methods using a small subset of data from LIGO’s first observing
run.}, journal={Classical and Quantum Gravity}, author={Zevin, M. and Coughlin, S. and Bahaadini, S. and Besler, E. and Rohani, N. and Allen, S. and Cabero, M. and Crowston, K. and Katsaggelos, A. K. and Larson, S. L. and et al.}, year={2017}, month={Mar}, pages={064003} }

The new generation of low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR: a Square Kilometre Array-low pathﬁnder), provides advancements in our capability of probing Galactic magnetism through low-frequency polarimetry. Maps of diﬀuse polarized radio emission and the associated Faraday rotation can be used to infer properties of, and trace structure in, the magnetic ﬁelds in the ISM. However, to date very little of the sky has been probed at high angular and Faraday depth resolution. We observed a 5◦ by 5◦ region centred on the nearby galaxy IC 342 ( = 138.2◦, b = +10.6◦) using the LOFAR high-band antennae in the frequency range 115–178 MHz. We imaged this region at 4.5 × 3.8 resolution and performed Faraday tomography to detect foreground Galactic polarized synchrotron emission separated by Faraday depth (diﬀerent amounts of Faraday rotation). Our Faraday depth cube shows a rich polarized structure, with up to 30 K of polarized emission at 150 MHz. We clearly detect two polarized features that extend over most of the ﬁeld, but are clearly separated in Faraday depth. Simulations of the behaviour of the depolarization of Faraday-thick structures at such low frequencies show that such structures would be too strongly depolarized to explain the observations. These structures are therefore rejected as the source of the observed polarized features. Only Faraday thin structures will not be strongly depolarized at low frequencies; producing such structures requires localized variations in the ratio of synchrotron emissivity to Faraday depth per unit distance. Such variations can arise from several physical phenomena, such as a transition between regions of ionized and (mostly) neutral gas. We conclude that the observed polarized emission is Faraday thin, and propose that the emission originates from two mostly neutral clouds in the local ISM. Using maps of the local ISM to estimate distances to these clouds, we have modelled the Faraday rotation for this line of sight and estimated that the strength of the line of sight component of magnetic ﬁeld of the local ISM for this direction varies between −0.86 and +0.12 µG (where positive is towards the Earth). We propose that this may be a useful method for mapping magnetic ﬁelds within the local ISM in all directions towards nearby neutral clouds.}, journal={Astronomy & Astrophysics}, author={Van Eck, C.
